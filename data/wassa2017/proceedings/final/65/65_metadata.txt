Abstract#==#In this paper, we present a novel ensemble learning architecture for emotion
intensity analysis, particularly a novel framework of ensemble method. The
ensemble method has two stages and each stage includes several single machine
learning models. In stage1, we employ both linear and nonlinear regression
models to obtain a more diverse emotion intensity representation. In stage2, we
use two regression models including linear regression and XGBoost. The result
of stage1 serves as the input of stage2, so the two different type models
(linear and non-linear) in stage2 can describe the input in two opposite
aspects. We also added a method for analyzing and splitting multi-words
hashtags and appending them to the emotion intensity corpus before feeding it
to our model. Our model achieves 0.571 Pearson-measure for the average of four
emotions.
