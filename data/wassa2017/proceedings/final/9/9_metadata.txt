Abstract#==#With the advent of word embeddings, lexicons are no longer fully utilized for
sentiment analysis although they still provide important features in the
traditional setting. This paper introduces a novel approach to sentiment
analysis that integrates lexicon embeddings and an attention mechanism into
Convolutional Neural Networks. Our approach performs separate convolutions for
word and lexicon embeddings and provides a global view of the document using
attention. Our models are experimented on both the SemEval'16 Task 4 dataset
and the Stanford Sentiment Treebank and show comparative or better results
against the existing state-of-the-art systems. Our analysis shows that lexicon
embeddings allow building high-performing models with much smaller word
embeddings, and the attention mechanism effectively dims out noisy words for
sentiment analysis.
