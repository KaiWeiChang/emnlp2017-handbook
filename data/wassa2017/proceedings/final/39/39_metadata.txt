Abstract#==#Patients turn to Online Health Communities not only for information on specific
conditions but also for emotional support. Previous research has indicated that
the progression of emotional status can be studied through the linguistic
patterns of an individual's posts.  We analyze a real-world dataset from the
Mental Health section of HealthBoards.com. Estimated from the word usages in
their posts, we find that the emotional progress across patients vary widely.

We study the problem of predicting a patient's emotional status in the future
from her past posts and we propose a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based
architecture to address it.  We find that the future emotional status can be
predicted with reasonable accuracy given her historical posts and participation
features. Our evaluation results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed
architecture, by outperforming state-of-the-art approaches with over 0.13
reduction in Mean Absolute Error.
