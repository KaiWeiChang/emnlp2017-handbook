Abstract#==#The EmoInt-2017 task aims to determine a continuous numerical value
representing the intensity to which an emotion is expressed in a tweet.
Compared to classification tasks that identify 1 among n emotions for a tweet,
the present task can provide more fine-grained (real-valued) sentiment
analysis. This paper presents a system that uses a bi-directional LSTM-CNN
model to complete the competition task. Combining bi-directional LSTM and CNN,
the prediction process considers both global information in a tweet and local
important information. The proposed method ranked sixth among twenty-one teams
in terms of Pearson Correlation Coefficient.
