Abstract#==#In this paper we present an annotated corpus created with the aim of analyzing
the
informative behaviour of emoji – an issue of importance for sentiment
analysis and
natural language processing. The corpus consists of 2475 tweets all containing
at
least one emoji, which has been annotated using one of the three possible
classes: Redundant, Non Redundant, and Non Redundant + POS. We explain how the
corpus
was collected, describe the annotation procedure and the interface developed
for the task. We provide an analysis of the corpus, considering also possible
predictive features, discuss the problematic aspects of the annotation, and
suggest future improvements.
