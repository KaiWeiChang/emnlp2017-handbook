Abstract#==#This paper describes the entry NUIG in the WASSA 2017 (8th Workshop on
Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment & Social Media Analysis)
shared task on emotion recognition.
The NUIG system used an SVR (SVM regression) and BLSTM ensemble, utilizing
primarily n-grams (for SVR features) and tweet word embeddings (for BLSTM
features). Experiments were carried out on several other candidate features,
some of which were added to the SVR model. 
Parameter selection for the SVR model was run as a grid search whilst
parameters for the BLSTM model were selected through a non-exhaustive ad-hoc
search.
