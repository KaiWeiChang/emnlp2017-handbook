Abstract#==#In this work, we present a first attempt to investigate multi-emoji expressions
and whether they behave similarly to multiword expressions in terms of
non-compositionality. We focus on the combination of the frog and the hot
beverage emoji, but also show some preliminary results for other
non-compositional emoji combinations. We use off-the-shelf sentiment analysers
as well as manual classifications to approach the compositionality of these
emoji combinations.
