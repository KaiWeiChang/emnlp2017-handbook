Abstract#==#Emotions can be triggered by various factors. According to the Appraisal
Theories (De Rivera, 1977; Frijda, 1986; Ortony et al., 1988; Johnson-Laird and
Oatley, 1989) emotions are elicited and differentiated on the basis of the
cognitive evaluation of the personal significance of a situation, object or
event based on “appraisal criteria” (intrinsic characteristics of objects
and events, significance of events to individual needs and goals,
individual’s ability to cope with the consequences of the event,
compatibility of event with social or personal standards, norms and values).
These differences in values can trigger reactions such as anger, disgust
(contempt), sadness, etc., because these behaviors are evaluated by the public
as being incompatible with their social/personal standards, norms or values. 
Such arguments are frequently present both in mainstream media, as well as
social media, building a society-wide view, attitude and emotional reaction
towards refugees/immigrants. In this demo, I will talk about experiments to
annotate and detect factual arguments that are linked to human
needs/motivations from text and in consequence trigger emotion in the media
audience and propose a new task for next year's WASSA.
