Abstract#==#The paper describes the best performing system for EmoInt - a shared task to
predict the intensity of emotions in tweets. Intensity is a real valued score,
between 0 and 1. The emotions are classified as - anger, fear, joy and sadness.
We apply three different deep neural network based models, which approach the
problem from essentially different directions. Our final performance quantified
by an average pearson correlation score of 74.7 and an average spearman
correlation score of 73.5 is obtained using an ensemble of the three models. We
outperform the baseline model of the shared task by 9.9\% and 9.4\% pearson and
spearman correlation scores respectively.
