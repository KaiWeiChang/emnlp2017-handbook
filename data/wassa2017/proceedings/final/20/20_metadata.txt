Abstract#==#There is a rich variety of data sets for sentiment analysis
  (viz.,~polarity and subjectivity classification). For the more
  challenging task of detecting discrete emotions following the
  definitions of Ekman and Plutchik, however, there are much fewer
  data sets, and notably no resources for the social media
  domain. This paper contributes to closing this gap by extending the
  \textit{SemEval 2016 stance and sentiment dataset} with emotion
  annotation. We (a) analyse annotation reliability and annotation
  merging; (b) investigate the relation between emotion annotation and
  the other annotation layers (stance, sentiment); (c) report
  modelling results as a baseline for future work.
