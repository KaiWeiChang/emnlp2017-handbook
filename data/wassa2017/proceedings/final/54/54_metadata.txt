Abstract#==#In this paper, we describe a method to predict emotion intensity in tweets. 
Our approach is an ensemble of three regression methods. The first method uses
content-based features (hashtags, emoticons, elongated words, etc.). The second
method considers word n-grams and character n-grams for training. The final
method uses lexicons, word embeddings, word n-grams, character n-grams for
training the model. An ensemble of these three methods gives better performance
than individual methods. We applied our method on WASSA emotion dataset.
Achieved results are as follows: average Pearson correlation is 0.706, average
Spearman correlation is 0.696, average Pearson correlation for gold scores in
range 0.5 to 1 is 0.539, and average Spearman correlation for gold scores in
range 0.5 to 1 is 0.514.
