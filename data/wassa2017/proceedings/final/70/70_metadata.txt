Abstract#==#Claims are the building blocks of arguments and the reasons underpinning
opinions, thus analyzing claims is important for both argumentation mining and
opinion mining. We propose a framework for representing claims as
microstructures, which express the beliefs, judgments, and policies about the
relations between domain-specific concepts. In a proof-of-concept study, we
manually build microstructures for over 800 claims extracted from an online
debate. We test the so-obtained microstructures on the task of claim stance
classification, achieving considerable improvements over text-based baselines.
