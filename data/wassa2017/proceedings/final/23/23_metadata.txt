Abstract#==#In this paper, we present a system that uses a convolutional neural network
with long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) model to complete the task. The CNN-LSTM
model has two combined parts: CNN extracts local n-gram features within tweets
and LSTM composes the features to capture long-distance dependency across
tweets. Additionally, we used other three models (CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM) as
baseline algorithms. Our introduced model showed good performance in the
experimental results.
