Abstract#==#Our submission to the WASSA-2017 shared task on the prediction of emotion
intensity in tweets is a supervised learning method with extended lexicons of
affective norms. We combine three main information sources in a random forrest
regressor, namely (1), manually created resources, (2) automatically extended
lexicons, and (3) the output of a neural network (CNN-LSTM) for sentence
regression. All three feature sets perform similarly well in isolation (≈ .67
macro average Pearson correlation). The combination achieves .72 on the
official test set (ranked 2nd out of 22 participants). Our analysis reveals
that performance is increased by providing cross-emotional intensity
predictions. The
automatic extension of lexicon features benefit from domain specific
embeddings.
Complementary ratings for affective norms increase the impact of lexicon
features. Our resources (ratings for 1.6 million twitter specific words) and
our implementation is publicly available at
