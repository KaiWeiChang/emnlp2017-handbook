Abstract#==#As a discipline of Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis is used to
extract and analyze subjective information present in natural language data.
The task of Sentiment Analysis has acquired wide commercial uses including
social media monitoring tasks, survey responses, review systems, etc. Languages
like English have several resources which aid in the task of Sentiment
Analysis. SentiWordNet and Subjectivity WordList are examples of such tools and
resources. With more data being available in native vernacular,
language-specific SentiWordNet(s) have become essential. For resource poor
languages, creating such SentiWordNet(s) is a difficult task to achieve. One
solution is to use available resources in English and translate the final
source lexicon to target lexicon via machine translation. Machine translation
systems for the English-Odia language pair have not yet been developed. In this
paper, we discuss a method to create a SentiWordNet for Odia, which is
resource-poor, by only using resources which are currently available for Indian
languages. The lexicon created, would serve as a tool for Sentiment Analysis
related task specific to Odia data.
