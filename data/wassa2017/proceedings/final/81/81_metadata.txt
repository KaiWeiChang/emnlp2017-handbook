Abstract#==#Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony that is intended to express contempt or
ridicule. Often quoted as a challenge to sentiment analysis, sarcasm involves
use of words of positive or no polarity to convey negative sentiment.
Incongruity has been observed to be at the heart of sarcasm understanding in
humans. Our work in sarcasm detection identifies different forms of incongruity
and employs different machine learning techniques to capture them. This talk
will describe the approach, datasets and challenges in sarcasm detection using
different forms of incongruity. 

We identify two forms of incongruity: incongruity which can be understood based
on the target text and common background knowledge, and incongruity which can
be understood based on the target text and additional, specific context. The
former involves use of sentiment-based features, word embeddings, and topic
models. The latter involves creation of author's historical context based on
their historical data, and creation of conversational context for sarcasm
detection of dialogue.
