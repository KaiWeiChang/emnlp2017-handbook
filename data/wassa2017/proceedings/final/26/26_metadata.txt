Abstract#==#This paper presents an integrated ABSA pipeline for Dutch that has been
developed and tested on qualitative user feedback coming from three domains:
retail, banking and human resources. The two latter domains provide
service-oriented data, which has not been investigated before in ABSA. By
performing in-domain and cross-domain experiments the validity of our approach
was investigated. We show promising results for the three ABSA subtasks, aspect
term extraction, aspect category classification and aspect polarity
classification.
