Abstract#==#This paper describes the UWaterloo affect prediction system developed for
EmoInt-2017. We delve into our feature selection approach for affect intensity,
affect presence, sentiment intensity and sentiment presence lexica alongside
pre-trained word embeddings, which are utilized to extract emotion intensity
signals from tweets in an ensemble learning approach. The system employs
emotion specific model training, and utilizes distinct models for each of the
emotion corpora in isolation. Our system utilizes gradient boosted regression
as the primary learning technique to predict the final emotion intensities.
