Abstract#==#Consumer spending is an important macroeconomic indicator that is used by
policy-makers to judge the health of an economy. In this paper we present a
novel method for predicting future consumer spending from social media data. In
contrast to previous work that largely relied on sentiment analysis, the
proposed method models consumer spending from purchase intentions found on
social media. Our experiments with time series analysis models and
machine-learning regression models reveal utility of this data for making
short-term forecasts of consumer spending: for three- and seven-day horizons,
prediction variables derived from social media help to improve forecast
accuracy by 11% to 18% for all the three models, in comparison to models that
used only autoregressive predictors.
