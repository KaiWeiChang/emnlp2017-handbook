Abstract#==#Mining arguments from natural language texts, parsing argumentative structures,
and assessing argument quality are among the recent challeng-es tackled in
computational argumentation. While advanced deep learning models provide
state-of-the-art performance in many of these tasks, much attention is also
paid to the underly-ing fundamental questions. How are arguments expressed in
natural language across genres and domains? What is the essence of an
argument's claim? Can we reliably annotate convincingness of an argument? How
can we approach logic and common-sense reasoning in argumentation? This talk
highlights some recent advances in computa-tional argumentation and shows why
researchers must be both "surfers" and "scuba divers".
