Abstract#==#This working note presents the methodology used in deepCybErNet submission to
the shared task on Emotion Intensities in Tweets (EmoInt) WASSA-2017. The goal
of the task is to predict a real valued score in the range [0-1] for a
particular tweet with an emotion type. To do this, we used Bag-of-Words and
embedding based on recurrent network architecture. We have developed two
systems and experiments are conducted on the Emotion Intensity shared Task 1
data base at WASSA- 2017. A system which uses word embedding based on recurrent
network architecture has achieved highest 5 fold cross-validation accuracy.
This has used embedding with recurrent network to extract optimal features at
tweet level and logistic regression for prediction. These methods are highly
language independent and experimental results shows that the proposed methods
are apt for predicting a real valued score in than range [0-1] for a given
tweet with its emotion type.
