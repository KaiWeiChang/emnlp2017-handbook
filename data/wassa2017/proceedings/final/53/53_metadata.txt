Abstract#==#This paper describes the system that we submitted as part of our participation
in the shared task on Emotion Intensity (EmoInt-2017). We propose a Long short
term memory (LSTM) based architecture cascaded with Support Vector Regressor
(SVR) for intensity prediction. We also employ Particle Swarm Optimization
(PSO) based feature selection algorithm for obtaining an optimized feature set
for training and evaluation. System evaluation shows interesting results on the
four emotion datasets i.e. anger, fear, joy and sadness. In comparison to the
other participating teams our system was ranked 5th in the competition.
