Abstract#==#There has been a good amount of progress in sentiment analysis over
  the past 10 years, including the proposal of new methods and the
  creation of benchmark datasets. In some papers, however, there is a
  tendency to compare models only on one or two datasets, either
  because of time restraints or because the model is tailored to a
  specific task. Accordingly, it is hard to understand how well a
  certain model generalizes across different tasks and datasets. In
  this paper, we contribute to this situation by comparing several
  models on six different benchmarks, which belong to different
  domains and additionally have different levels of granularity
  (binary, 3-class, 4-class and 5-class). We show that Bi-LSTMs
  perform well across datasets and that both LSTMs and Bi-LSTMs are
  particularly good at fine-grained sentiment tasks (\ie, with more
  than two classes). Incorporating sentiment information
  into word embeddings during training gives good results for datasets
  that are lexically similar to the training data. With our
  experiments, we contribute to a better understanding of the
  performance of different model architectures on different data
  sets. Consequently, we detect
  novel state-of-the-art results on the \textit{SenTube} datasets.
