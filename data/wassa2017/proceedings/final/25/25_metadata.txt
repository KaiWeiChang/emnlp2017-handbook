Abstract#==#Social media are used by an increasing number of political actors. A
small subset of these is interested in pursuing extremist motives
such as mobilization, recruiting or radicalization activities. In
order to counteract these trends, online providers and state
institutions reinforce their monitoring efforts, mostly relying on
manual workflows. We propose a machine learning approach
to support manual attempts towards identifying right-wing extremist
content in German Twitter profiles. Based on a fine-grained
conceptualization of right-wing extremism, we frame the task as
ranking each individual profile on a continuum spanning different
degrees of right-wing extremism, based on a nearest neighbour
approach. A quantitative evaluation reveals that our ranking model
yields robust performance (up to 0.81 F$_1$ score) when being used
for predicting discrete class labels. At the same time, the model 
provides plausible continuous ranking scores for a small
sample of borderline cases at the division of right-wing extremism 
and New Right political movements.
