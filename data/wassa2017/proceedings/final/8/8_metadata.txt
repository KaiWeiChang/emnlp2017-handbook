Abstract#==#Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) is a rich dictionary that map words
into several psychological categories such as Affective, Social, Cognitive,
Perceptual and Biological processes. In this work, we have used LIWC
psycholinguistic categories to train regression models and predict emotion
intensity in tweets for the EmoInt-2017 task. Results show that LIWC features
may boost emotion intensity prediction on the basis of a low dimension set.
