Abstract#==#The WASSA 2017 EmoInt shared task has
the goal to predict emotion intensity values
of tweet messages. Given the text of
a tweet and its emotion category (anger,
joy, fear, and sadness), the participants
were asked to build a system that assigns
emotion intensity values. Emotion intensity
estimation is a challenging problem
given the short length of the tweets, the
noisy structure of the text and the lack
of annotated data. To solve this problem,
we developed an ensemble of two neural
models, processing input on the character.
and word-level with a lexicon-driven
system. The correlation scores across all
four emotions are averaged to determine
the bottom-line competition metric, and
our system ranks place forth in full intensity
range and third in 0.5-1 range of intensity
among 23 systems at the time of
writing (June 2017).
