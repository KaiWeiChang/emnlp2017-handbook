Abstract#==#Aspect Term Extraction (ATE) identifies opinionated aspect terms in texts and
is one of the tasks in the SemEval Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)
contest. The small amount of available datasets for supervised ATE and the
costly human annotation for aspect term labelling give rise to the need for
unsupervised ATE. In this paper, we introduce an architecture that achieves
top-ranking performance for supervised ATE. Moreover, it can be used
efficiently as feature extractor and classifier for unsupervised ATE. Our
second contribution is a method to automatically construct datasets for ATE. We
train a classifier on our automatically labelled datasets and evaluate it on
the human annotated SemEval ABSA test sets. Compared to a strong rule-based
baseline, we obtain a dramatically higher F-score and attain precision values
above 80%. Our unsupervised method beats the supervised ABSA baseline from
SemEval, while preserving high precision scores.
