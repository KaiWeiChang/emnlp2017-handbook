Abstract#==#This paper presents a summary of the first Workshop on Building Linguistically
Generalizable Natural Language Processing Systems, and the associated Build It
Break It, The Language Edition shared task. The goal of this workshop was to
bring together researchers in NLP and linguistics with a carefully designed
shared task aimed at testing the generalizability of NLP systems beyond the
distributions of their training data. We describe the motivation, setup, and
participation of the shared task, provide discussion of some highlighted
results, and discuss lessons learned.
