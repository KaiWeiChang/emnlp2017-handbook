Abstract#==#Previous phrase-based approaches to Automatic Post-editing (APE) shown that the
dependency of MT errors from the source sentence can be exploited by jointly
learning from source and target information. By integrating this notion in a
neural approach to the problem, we present the multi-source neural machine
translation (NMT) system submitted by FBK to the WMT 2017 APE shared task. Our
system implements multi-source NMT in a weighted ensemble of 8 models. The
n-best hypotheses produced by this ensemble are further re-ranked using
features based on the edit distance between the original MT output and each APE
hypothesis, as well as other statistical models (ngram language model and
operation sequence model). This solution yields significantly
better performance compared to standard, single-source neural APE. Our
primary submission for the en-de direction improves over the MT baseline up to
-4.9 TER and +7.6 BLEU points. On de-en data, where the higher quality of the
original MT output reduces the room for improvement, the gains are lower but
still significant (-0.25 TER and +0.3 BLEU)
