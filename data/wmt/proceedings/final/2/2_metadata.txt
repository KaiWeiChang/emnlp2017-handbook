Abstract#==#This paper describes the neural machine translation systems of the University
of Latvia, University of Zurich and University of Tartu. We participated in the
WMT 2017 shared task on news translation by building systems for two language
pairs: English - German and English - Latvian. Our systems are based on an
attentional encoder-decoder, using BPE subword segmentation. We experimented
with backtranslating the monolingual news corpora and filtering out the best
translations as additional training data, enforcing named entity translation
from a dictionary of parallel named entities, penalizing over- and
under-translated sentences, and combining output from multiple NMT systems with
SMT. The described methods give 0.7 - 1.8 BLEU point improvements over our
baseline systems.
