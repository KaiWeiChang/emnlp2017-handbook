Abstract#==#The paper describes Tilde's English-Latvian and Latvian-English machine
translation systems for the WMT 2017 shared task in news translation. Both
constrained and unconstrained systems are described. Our constrained systems
were ranked as the best performing systems according to the automatic
evaluation results. The paper gives details to how we pre-processed training
data, the NMT system architecture that we used for training the NMT models, the
SMT systems and their usage in NMT-SMT hybrid system configurations.
