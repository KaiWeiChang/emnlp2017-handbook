Abstract#==#This paper presents the contribution of the Unbabel team to the WMT 2017 Shared
Task on Translation Quality Estimation. We participated on the word-level and
sentence-level tracks. We describe our two submitted systems: (i) StackedQE,
a "pure" QE system, trained only on the provided training sets, which is a
stacked combination of a feature-rich sequential linear model with a neural
network, and (ii) FullStackedQE, which also stacks the predictions of an
automatic post-editing system, trained on additional data. When evaluated on
the English-German and German-English datasets, FullStackedQE achieved
word-level F1-MULT scores of 56.6% and 52.9%, and sentence-level correlation
Pearson scores of 64.1% and 62.6%, respectively. Our system ranked second in
both tracks, being statistically indistinguishable from the best system in the
word-level track.
