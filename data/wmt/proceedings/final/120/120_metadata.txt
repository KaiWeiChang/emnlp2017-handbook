Abstract#==#In this paper, we attempt to improve Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)
systems between Czech, Latvian and English in WNT’17 News translation task.
We also participated in the Biomedical task and produces translation engines
from English into Polish, Czech, German, Spanish, French, Hungarian, Romanian
and Swedish. To accomplish this, we performed translation model training,
created adaptations of training settings for each language pair, and
implemented BPE (subword units) for our SMT systems. Innovative tools and data
adaptation techniques were employed. Only the official parallel text corpora
and monolingual models for the WMT 2017 evaluation campaign were used to train
language models, and to develop, tune, and test the system. We explored the use
of domain adaptation techniques, symmetrized word alignment models, the
unsupervised transliteration models and the KenLM language modeling tool. To
evaluate the effects of different preparations on translation results, we
conducted experiments and used the BLEU, NIST and TER metrics. Our results
indicate that our approach produced a positive impact on SMT quality.
