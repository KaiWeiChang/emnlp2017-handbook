Abstract#==#Following upon the last year's CUNI system for automatic post-editing of
machine translation output,
we focus on exploiting the potential of sequence-to-sequence neural models for
this task. In this system description paper, we compare several encoder-decoder
architectures on a smaller-scale models and present the system we submitted to
WMT 2017 Automatic Post-Editing shared task based on this preliminary
comparison. We also show how simple inclusion of synthetic data can improve the
overall performance as measured by an automatic evaluation metric. Lastly, we
list few example outputs generated by our post-editing system.
