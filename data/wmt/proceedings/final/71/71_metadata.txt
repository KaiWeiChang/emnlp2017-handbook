Abstract#==#This article describes the Aalto University entry to the English-to-Finnish
news translation shared task in WMT 2017. Our system is an open vocabulary
neural machine translation (NMT) system, adapted to the needs of a
morphologically complex target language. The main contributions of this paper
are 1) implicitly incorporating morphological information to NMT through
multi-task learning, 2) adding an attention mechanism to the character-level
decoder, combined with character segmentation of names, and 3) a new
overattending penalty
to beam search.
