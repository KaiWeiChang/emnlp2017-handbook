Abstract#==#In this paper we explore several neural network architectures for the WMT 2017
multimodal translation sub-task on multilingual image caption generation. The
goal of the task is to generate image captions in German, using a training
corpus of images with captions in both English and German. We explore several
models which attempt to generate captions for both languages, ignoring the
English output during evaluation. We compare the results to a baseline
implementation which uses only the German captions for training and show
significant improvement.
