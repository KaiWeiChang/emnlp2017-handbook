Abstract#==#This paper describes LIMSI participation to the WMT'17 shared task
  on Bandit Learning. The method we propose to adapt a seed system
  trained on out-domain data to a new, unknown domain relies on two
  components. First, we use a linear regression model to exploit the
  weak and partial feedback the system receives by learning to predict
  the reward a translation hypothesis will get. This model can then be
  used to score hypotheses of the search space and translate source
  sentences while taking into account the specificities of the
  in-domain data. Second, we use the UCB1 algorithm to choose which of
  the `adapted' or `seed' system must be used to translate a given
  source sentence in order to maximize the cumulative reward.

  Results on the development and train sets show that the proposed
  method does not succeed in improving the seed system. We explore
  several hypotheses to explain this disappointing result.
