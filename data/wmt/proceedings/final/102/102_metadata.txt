Abstract#==#Pivot translation is a useful method for translating between languages with
little or no parallel data by utilizing parallel data in an intermediate
language such as English.
A popular approach for pivot translation used in phrase-based or tree-based
translation models combines source-pivot and pivot-target translation models
into a source-target model, as known as triangulation.
However, this combination is based on the constituent wordsâ€™surface forms and
often produces incorrect source-target phrase pairs due to semantic ambiguity
in the pivot language, and interlingual differences.
This degrades translation accuracy.
In this paper, we propose a approach for the triangulation using syntactic
subtrees in the pivot language to distinguish pivot language words by their
syntactic roles to avoid incorrect phrase combinations.
Experimental results on the United Nations Parallel Corpus show the proposed
method gains in all tested combinations of language, up to 2.3 BLEU points.
