Abstract#==#Word sense disambiguation is necessary in translation because different word
senses often have different translations. Neural machine translation models
learn different senses of words as part of an end-to-end translation task, and
their capability to perform word sense disambiguation has so far not been
quantified. 
We exploit the fact that neural translation models can score arbitrary
translations to design a novel cross-lingual word sense disambiguation task
that is tailored towards evaluating neural machine translation models. We
present a test set of 7,200 lexical ambiguities for German-English, and 6,700
for German-French, and report baseline results. With 70% of lexical
ambiguities correctly disambiguated, we find that word sense disambiguation
remains a challenging problem for neural machine translation, especially for
rare word senses.
To improve word sense disambiguation in neural machine translation, we
experiment with two methods to integrate sense embeddings. In a first approach
we pass sense embeddings as additional input to the neural machine translation
system. For the second experiment, we extract lexical chains based on
sense embeddings from the document and integrate this information into the NMT
model. While a baseline NMT system disambiguates frequent word senses quite
reliably, the annotation with both sense labels and lexical chains improves the
neural modelsâ€™ performance on rare word senses.
