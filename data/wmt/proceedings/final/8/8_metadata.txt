Abstract#==#The system described here deliberately avoids any statistical elements in
translation process. The basic assumption is that running text can always be
decomposed into structured units, and that these units can be described on more
or less general level. The translation is not performed on the basis of surface
word forms, but rather as a controlled sequence of operations, where the text
in source language is processed into surface form of the target language. The
basic components in the system are the lexicon and grammar of both languages.
On the abstract level, the language can be described by means of tags, each of
which represents various degrees of abstractness. For example POS tags are the
most abstract ones, each representing a large set of members, whereas word
lemmas are least abstract, and morphological tags are somewhere in between. The
combination of the tags constitutes the knowledge, on the basis of which the
text is converted into the surface form of the target language.
