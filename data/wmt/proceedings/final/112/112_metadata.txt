Abstract#==#Existing metrics to evaluate the quality of Machine Translation hypotheses take
different perspectives
into account. DPMFcomb, a metric combining the merits of a range of metrics,
achieved the
best performance for evaluation of to-English language pairs in the previous
two years of WMT Metrics Shared Tasks.
This year, we submit a novel combined metric, Blend, to WMT17 Metrics task. 
Compared to DPMFcomb, Blend includes the following adaptations: i) We use DA
human evaluation to guide the training process with a vast reduction in
required training data, while still achieving improved performance when
evaluated on WMT16 to-English language pairs; 
ii) We carry out experiments to explore the contribution of metrics
incorporated in Blend, 
in order to find a trade-off between performance and efficiency.
