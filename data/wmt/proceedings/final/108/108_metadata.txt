Abstract#==#This paper describes Oregon State University's submissions to the shared 
WMT'17 task ``multimodal translation task I''. 
In this task, all the sentence pairs are image captions in different languages.

The key difference between this task and conventional machine translation is
that we have corresponding images as additional information for each sentence
pair. 
In this paper, we introduce a simple but effective system which takes an image
shared between different languages, 
feeding it into the both encoding and decoding side. 
We report our system's performance for English-French and English-German with
Flickr30K (in-domain) and MSCOCO (out-of-domain) datasets. 
Our system achieves the best performance in TER for English-German for MSCOCO
dataset.
