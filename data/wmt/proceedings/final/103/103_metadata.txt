Abstract#==#This work describes the AMU-UEdin submission to the WMT 2017 shared task on
Automatic Post-Editing. We explore multiple neural architectures adapted for
the task of automatic post-editing of machine translation output.  We focus on
neural end-to-end models that combine both inputs $\mt$ and $\src$ in a single
neural architecture, modeling $\{\mt, \src\} \rightarrow \pe$ directly. Apart
from that, we investigate the influence of hard-attention models which seem to
be well-suited for monolingual tasks, as well as combinations of both ideas.
