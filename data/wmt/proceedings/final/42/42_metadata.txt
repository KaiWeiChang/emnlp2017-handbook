Abstract#==#This submission investigates alternative machine learning models for predicting
the HTER score on the sentence level. Instead of directly predicting the HTER
score, we suggest a model that jointly predicts the amount of the 4 distinct
post-editing operations, which are then used to calculate the HTER score. This
also gives the possibility to correct invalid (e.g.~negative) predicted values
prior to the calculation of the HTER score. Without any feature exploration, a
multi-layer perceptron with 4 outputs yields small but significant improvements
over the baseline.
