Abstract#==#We describe a new version of MEANT, which participated in the metrics task of 
the Second Conference on Machine Translation (WMT 2017). MEANT 2.0 uses idf-
weighted distributional ngram accuracy to determine the phrasal similarity of 
semantic role fillers and yields better correlations with human judgments of 
translation quality than earlier versions. The improved phrasal similarity 
enables a subversion of MEANT to accurately evaluate translation adequacy for 
any output language, even languages without an automatic semantic parser. Our 
results show that MEANT, which is a non-ensemble and untrained metric, 
consistently performs as well as the top  participants in previous years - 
including ensemble and trained ones - across different output languages. We
also 
present the timing statistics for MEANT for better estimation of the evaluation

cost. MEANT 2.0 is open source and publicly 
available.
