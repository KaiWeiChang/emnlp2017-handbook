Abstract#==#Neural machine translation (NMT) models are able to partially learn syntactic
information from sequential lexical information. Still, some complex syntactic
phenomena such as prepositional phrase attachment are poorly modeled. This work
aims to answer two questions: 1) Does explicitly modeling target language
syntax help NMT? 2) Is tight integration of words and syntax better than
multitask training?
We introduce syntactic information in the form of CCG supertags in the decoder,
by interleaving the target supertags with the word sequence. Our results on WMT
data show that explicitly modeling target-syntax improves machine translation
quality for German->English, a high-resource pair, and for Romanian->English, a
low-resource pair and also several syntactic phenomena including prepositional
phrase attachment. Furthermore, a tight coupling of words and syntax improves
translation quality more than multitask training. By combining target-syntax
with adding source-side dependency labels in the embedding layer, we obtain a
total improvement of  0.9 BLEU for German->English and 1.2 BLEU for
Romanian->English.
