Abstract#==#We participated in the WMT 2016 shared news translation task on English and
Chinese language pair.
Our systems are based on the encoder-decoder neural machine translation model
with the attention mechanism.
We employ the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with the linear associative connection
to build deep encoder and address the unknown words with the dictionary replace
approach.
The dictionaries are extracted from the parallel training data with
unsupervised word alignment method.
In the decoding procedure, the translation probabilities of the target word
from different models are averagely combined as the ensemble strategy.
In this paper, we introduce our systems from data preprocessing to post-editing
in details.
