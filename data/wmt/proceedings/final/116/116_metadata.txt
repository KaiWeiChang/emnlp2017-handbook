Abstract#==#Character n-gram F-score (chrF) is shown to correlate very well with human
relative rankings of different machine translation outputs, especially for
morphologically rich target languages. However, its relation with direct human
assessments is not yet clear. 
In this work, Pearson's correlation coefficients for direct assessments are
investigated for two currently available target languages, English and Russian.
First, different beta parameters (in range from 1  to 3) are re-investigated
with direct assessment,  and it is confirmed that beta = 2 is the optimal
option.
Then separate character and word n-grams are investigated, and the main finding

is that, apart from character n-grams, word 1-grams and 2-grams also correlate
rather well with direct assessments. 
Further experiments show that adding word unigrams and bigrams to the standard
chrF score improves the correlations with direct assessments, though it is
still not clear which option is better, unigrams only (chrF+) or unigrams and
bigrams (chrF++). This should be investigated in future work on more target
languages.
