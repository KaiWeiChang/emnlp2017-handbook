Abstract#==#In this paper, we present a two-stage neural quality estimation model that uses
multilevel task learning for translation quality estimation (QE) at the
sentence, word, and phrase levels. Our approach is based on an end-to-end
stacked neural model named Predictor-Estimator, which has two stages consisting
of a neural word prediction model and neural QE model. 
To efficiently train the two-stage model, a stack propagation method is
applied, thereby enabling us to jointly learn the word prediction model and QE
model in a single learning mode. In addition, we deploy multilevel task
learning with stack propagation, where the training examples available for all
QE subtasks (i.e., sentence/word/phrase levels) are used to train a
Predictor-Estimator for a specific subtask. All of our submissions to the QE
task of WMT17 are ensembles that combine a set of neural models trained under
different settings of varying dimensionalities and shuffling training examples,
eventually achieving the best performances for all subtasks at the sentence,
word, and phrase levels.
