Abstract#==#We introduce and describe the results of a novel shared task on bandit learning
for machine translation. The task was organized jointly by Amazon and
Heidelberg University for the first time at the Second Conference on Machine
Translation (WMT 2017). The goal of the task is to encourage research on
learning machine translation from weak user feedback instead of human
references or post-edits. On each of a sequence of rounds, a machine
translation system is required to propose a translation for an input, and
receives a real-valued estimate of the quality of the proposed translation for
learning. This paper describes the shared task's learning and evaluation setup,
using services hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), the data and evaluation
metrics, and the results of various machine translation architectures and
learning protocols.
