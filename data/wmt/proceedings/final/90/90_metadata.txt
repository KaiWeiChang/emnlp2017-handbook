Abstract#==#The field of Quality Estimation (QE) has the goal to provide automatic methods
for the evaluation of Machine Translation (MT), that do not require reference
translations in their computation. We present our submission to the sentence
level WMT17 Quality Estimation Shared Task. It combines tree and sequence
kernels for predicting the post-editing effort of the target sentence. The
kernels exploit both the source and target sentences, but also a
back-translation of the candidate translation. The evaluation results show that
the kernel approach combined with the baseline features brings substantial
improvement over the baseline system.
