Abstract#==#In this paper we report on FBK's participation to the English-to-German news
translation task of the Second Conference on Machine Translation (WMT'17). The
submitted system is based on Neural Machine Translation using byte-pair
encoding segmentation on both source and target languages for open-vocabulary
translations. Back-translations of news monolingual data are used for improving
the translations fluency on the in-domain data. With respect to  last year's
evaluation, our baseline outperforms the 2016 best system's baseline on the
test sets  2015 and 2016. However, in our set-up  back-translations produced a
smaller improvement than expected. The final submission is given by the
combination of 7 systems, including a system trained only on true parallel data
and two right-to-left systems, which improves over our single best system by
1.5 BLEU points.
