Abstract#==#This paper describes the NICT-NAIST
system for the WMT 2017 shared multimodal
machine translation task for both
language pairs, English-to-German and
English-to-French. We built a hierarchical
phrase-based (Hiero) translation system
and trained an attentional encoder-decoder
neural machine translation (NMT) model
to rerank the n-best output of the Hiero
system, which obtained significant gains
over both the Hiero system and NMT decoding
alone. We also present a multimodal
NMT model that integrates the target
language descriptions of images that
are similar to the image described by the
source sentence as additional inputs of the
neural networks to help the translation of
the source sentence. We give detailed
analysis for the results of the multimodal
NMT model.
