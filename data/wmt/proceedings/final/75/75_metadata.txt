Abstract#==#We investigate the application of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) under the
following three conditions posed by real-world application scenarios. First, we
operate with an input stream of sentences coming from many different domains
and with no predefined order. Second, the sentences are presented without
domain information. Third, the input stream should be processed by a single
generic NMT model.
To tackle the weaknesses of current NMT technology in this unsupervised
multi-domain setting, we explore an efficient instance-based adaptation method
that, by exploiting the similarity between the training instances and each test
sentence, dynamically sets the hyperparameters of the learning algorithm and
updates the generic model on-the-fly.
The results of our experiments with multi-domain data show that local
adaptation outperforms not only the original generic NMT system, but also a
strong phrase-based system and even single-domain NMT models  specifically
optimized on each domain and applicable only by violating two of our
aforementioned assumptions.
