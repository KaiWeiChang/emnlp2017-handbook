Abstract#==#Machine translation quality estimation is a challenging task in the WMT
evaluation campaign. Feature extraction plays an important role in automatic
quality estimation, and in this paper, we propose neural network features,
including embedding features and cross-entropy features of source sentences and
machine translations, to improve machine translation quality estimation. The
sentence embedding features are extracted through global average pooling from
word embedding and are trained by the word2vec toolkits, while the sentence
cross-entropy features are calculated by the recurrent neural network language
model. The experimental results on the development set of WMT17 machine
translation quality estimation tasks show that the neural network features gain
significant improvements over the baseline. Furthermore, when combining the
neural network features and the baseline features, the system performance
obtains further improvement.
