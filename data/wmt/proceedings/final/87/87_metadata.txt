Abstract#==#For efficiency considerations, state-of-the-art neural machine translation
(NMT) requires the vocabulary to be restricted to a limited-size set of several
thousand symbols. This is highly problematic when translating into inflected or
compounding languages. A typical remedy is the use of subword units, where
words are segmented into smaller components. Byte pair encoding, a purely
corpus-based approach, has proved effective recently.

In this paper, we investigate word segmentation strategies that incorporate
more linguistic knowledge. We demonstrate that linguistically informed target
word segmentation is better suited for NMT, leading to improved translation
quality on the order of magnitude of +0.5 BLEU and -0.9 TER for a medium-scale
English-to-German translation task.

Our work is important in that it shows that linguistic knowledge can be used to
improve NMT results over results based only on the language-agnostic byte pair
encoding vocabulary reduction technique.
