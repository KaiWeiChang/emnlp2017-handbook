Abstract#==#Referential translation machines achieve top performance in both bilingual and
monolingual settings 
without accessing any task or domain specific information or resource.
RTMs achieve the $3$rd system results for German to English sentence-level
prediction of 
translation quality and the $2$nd system results according to root mean squared
error.
In addition to the new features about substring distances, punctuation tokens,
character 
$n$-grams, and alignment crossings, and additional learning models, we average
prediction scores 
from different models using weights based on their training performance for
improved results.
