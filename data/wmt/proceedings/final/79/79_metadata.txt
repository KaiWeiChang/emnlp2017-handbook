Abstract#==#Differently from the phrase-based paradigm, neural machine translation (NMT)
operates on word and sentence representations in a continuous space. This makes
the decoding process not only more difficult to interpret, but also harder to
influence with external knowledge. For the latter problem, effective solutions
like the XML-markup used by phrase-based models to inject fixed translation
options as constraints at decoding time are not yet available. We propose a
“guide” mechanism that enhances an existing NMT decoder with the ability to
prioritize and adequately handle translation options presented in the form of
XML annotations of source words. Positive results obtained in two different
translation tasks indicate the effectiveness of our approach.
