Abstract#==#This paper describes the Neural Machine Translation systems of Xiamen
University for the translation tasks of WMT 17. Our systems are based on the
Encoder-Decoder framework with attention. We participated in three directions
of shared news translation tasks: Englis->German and Chinese<->English. We
experimented with deep architectures, different segmentation models, synthetic
training data and target-bidirectional translation models. Experiments show
that all methods can give substantial improvements.
