Abstract#==#We present in this paper the participation of the University of Hamburg in the
Biomedical Translation Task of the Second Conference on Machine Translation
(WMT 2017). Our contribution lies in adopting a new direction for performing
data selection for Machine Translation via Paragraph Vector and a Feed Forward
Neural Network Classifier. Continuous distributed vector representations of the
sentences are used as features for the binary classifier. Most approaches in
data selection rely on scoring and ranking general domain sentences with
respect to their similarity to the in-domain and setting a range of thresholds
for selecting a percentage of them for training various MT systems. The novelty
of our method consists in developing an automatic threshold detection paradigm
for data selection which provides an efficient and simple way for selecting the
most similar sentences to the in-domain. Encouraging results are obtained using
this approach for seven language pairs and four data sets.
