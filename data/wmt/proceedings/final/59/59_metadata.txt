Abstract#==#It has been shown that increasing model depth improves the quality of neural
machine translation.
However, different architectural variants to increase model depth have been
proposed, and so far, there has been no thorough comparative study.

In this work, we describe and evaluate several existing approaches to introduce
depth in neural machine translation.
Additionally, we explore novel architectural variants, including deep
transition RNNs, and we vary how attention is used in the deep decoder.
We introduce a novel "BiDeep" RNN architecture that combines deep transition
RNNs and stacked RNNs.

Our evaluation is carried out on the English to German WMT news translation
dataset, using a single-GPU machine for both training and inference.
We find that several of our proposed architectures improve upon existing
approaches in terms of speed and translation quality.
We obtain best improvements with a BiDeep RNN of combined depth 8, obtaining an
average improvement of 1.5  Bleu over a strong shallow baseline.

We release our code for ease of adoption.
