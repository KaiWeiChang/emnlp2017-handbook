Abstract#==#NMT systems have problems with large vocabulary sizes. Byte-pair encoding (BPE)
is a popular approach to solving this problem, but while BPE allows the system
to generate any target-side word, it does not enable effective generalization
over the rich vocabulary in morphologically rich languages with strong
inflectional phenomena. We introduce a simple approach to overcome this problem
by training a system to produce the lemma of a word and its morphologically
rich POS tag, which is then followed by a deterministic generation step. We
apply this strategy for English--Czech and English--German translation
scenarios, obtaining improvements in both settings. We furthermore show that
the improvement is not due to only adding explicit morphological information.
