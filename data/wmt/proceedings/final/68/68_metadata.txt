Abstract#==#This paper describes the neural and phrase-based machine translation systems
submitted by CUNI to English-Czech News Translation Task of WMT17. We
experiment with synthetic data for training and try several system combination
techniques, both neural and phrase-based. Our primary submission
CU-Chimera ends up being phrase-based backbone which includes neural
and deep-syntactic candidate translations.
