Abstract#==#We present a new model for text regression that seamlessly combine engineered
features and character-level information through deep parallel convolution
stacks, multi-layer perceptrons and multi-task learning. We use these models to
create the SHEF/CNN systems for the sentence-level Quality Estimation task of
WMT 2017 and Emotion Intensity Analysis task of WASSA 2017. Our experiments
reveal that combining character-level clues and engineered features offers
noticeable performance improvements over using only one of these sources of
information in isolation.
