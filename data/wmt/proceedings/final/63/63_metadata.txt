Abstract#==#We train a neural machine translation (NMT) system to both translate
source-language text and copy target-language text, thereby exploiting
monolingual corpora in the target language. Specifically, we create a bitext
from the monolingual text in the target language so that each source sentence
is identical to the target sentence. This copied data is then mixed with the
parallel corpus and the NMT system is trained like normal, with no metadata to
distinguish the two input languages.

Our proposed method proves to be an effective way of incorporating monolingual
data into low-resource NMT. On Turkish-English and Romanian-English translation
tasks, we see gains of up to 1.2 BLEU over a strong baseline with
back-translation. Further analysis shows that the linguistic phenomena behind
these gains are different from and largely orthogonal to back-translation, with
our copied corpus method improving accuracy on named entities and other words
that should remain identical between the source and target languages.
