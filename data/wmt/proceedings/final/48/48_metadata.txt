Abstract#==#We describe the JAIST phrase-based machine translation systems that
participated in the news translation shared task of the WMT17. In this work, we
participated in the Turkish-English translation, in which only a small amount
of bilingual training data is available, so that it is an example of the
low-resource setting in machine translation. In order to solve the problem, we
focus on two strategies: building a bilingual corpus from comparable data and
exploiting existing parallel data based on phrase pivot translation. In order
to utilize the strategies to enhance machine translation on the low-resource
setting most effectively, we introduce a system combining the extracted corpus,
the pivot translation, and the direct training
data. Experimental results showed that our combined systems significantly
improved the baseline models, which were trained on the small bilingual data.
