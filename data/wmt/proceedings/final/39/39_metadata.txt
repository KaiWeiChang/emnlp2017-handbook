Abstract#==#The WMT17 Neural Machine Translation Training Task aimed to test various
methods of training neural machine translation systems. We describe the AFRL
submission, including preprocessing and its knowledge distillation framework.
The teacher systems are given factors for domain, case, and subword location.
The student systems are given multiple teachers’ output and a subselected set
of the training data designed to match the target domain. Numerical results
indicate that the
student systems surpass the teachers in translation quality and that this
benefit comes directly from the inclusion of the teachers’ output.
