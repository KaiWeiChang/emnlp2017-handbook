Abstract#==#We describe the neural machine translation system submitted by the University
of Rochester to the Chinese-English language pair for the WMT 2017 news
translation task. We applied unsupervised word and subword segmentation
techniques and deep learning in order to address (i) the word segmentation
problem caused by the lack of delimiters between words and phrases in Chinese
and (ii) the morphological and syntactic differences between Chinese and
English. We integrated promising recent developments in NMT, including
back-translations, language model reranking, subword splitting and minimum risk
tuning.
