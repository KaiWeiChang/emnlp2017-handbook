\title{Word Representations in Factored Neural Machine Translation}

% Author information can be set in various styles:
% For several authors from the same institution:
% \author{Author 1 \and ... \and Author n \\
%         Address line \\ ... \\ Address line}
% if the names do not fit well on one line use
%         Author 1 \\ {\bf Author 2} \\ ... \\ {\bf Author n} \\
% For authors from different institutions:
% \author{Author 1 \\ Address line \\  ... \\ Address line
%         \And  ... \And
%         Author n \\ Address line \\ ... \\ Address line}
% To start a seperate ``row'' of authors use \AND, as in
% \author{Author 1 \\ Address line \\  ... \\ Address line
%         \AND
%         Author 2 \\ Address line \\ ... \\ Address line \And
%         Author 3 \\ Address line \\ ... \\ Address line}
% If the title and author information does not fit in the area allocated,
% place \setlength\titlebox{<new height>} right after
% at the top, where <new height> can be something larger than 2.25in

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Translation into a morphologically rich language
  requires a large output vocabulary to model various
  morphological phenomena, which is a challenge for
  neural machine translation architectures. To address this issue,
  the present paper investigates the impact of having
  two output factors with a system able to generate
  separately two distinct representations of the target
  words. Within this framework, we investigate
  several word representations that correspond to
  different distributions of morpho-syntactic information
  across both factors. We report experiments for translation
  from English into two morphologically rich languages,
  Czech and Latvian, and show the importance of explicitly
  modeling target morphology.
