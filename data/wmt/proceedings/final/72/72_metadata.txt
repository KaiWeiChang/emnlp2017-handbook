Abstract#==#While recent changes in Machine Translation state-of-the-art
brought translation quality a step further, it is regularly acknowledged 
that the standard automatic metrics do not provide enough insights
to fully measure the impact of neural models.
This paper proposes a new type of evaluation focused specifically
on the morphological competence of a system with respect
to various grammatical phenomena. Our approach uses automatically generated
pairs of source sentences, where each pair tests one morphological contrast. 
This methodology is used to compare several systems submitted
at WMT'17 for English into Czech and Latvian.
