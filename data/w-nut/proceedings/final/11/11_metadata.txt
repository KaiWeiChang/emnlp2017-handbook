Abstract#==#Does normalization help Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging accuracy on noisy,
non-canonical data?
To the best of our knowledge, little is known on the actual impact of
normalization in a real-world scenario, where gold error detection is not
available.  We investigate the effect of automatic normalization on POS tagging
of tweets.
We also compare normalization to strategies that leverage large amounts of
unlabeled data kept in its raw form.  Our results show that normalization
helps, but does not add  consistently beyond just word embedding layer
initialization. The latter approach yields a tagging model that is competitive
with a Twitter state-of-the-art tagger.
