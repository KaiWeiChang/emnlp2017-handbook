Abstract#==#This shared task focuses on identifying unusual, previously-unseen entities in
the context of emerging discussions. Named entities form the basis of many
modern approaches to other tasks (like event clustering and summarization), but
recall on them is a real problem in noisy text - even among annotators. This
drop tends to be due to novel entities and surface forms. Take for example the
tweet "so.. kktny in 30 mins?!" -- even human experts find the entity 'kktny'
hard to detect and resolve. The goal of this task is to provide a definition of
emerging and of rare entities, and based on that, also datasets for detecting
these entities. The task as described in this paper evaluated the ability of
participating entries to detect and classify novel and emerging named entities
in noisy text.
