Abstract#==#The majority of research on extracting missing user attributes from social
media profiles use costly hand-annotated labels for supervised learning.
Distantly supervised methods exist, although these generally rely on knowledge
gathered using external sources. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of
gathering distant labels for self-reported gender on Twitter using simple
queries. We confirm the reliability of this query heuristic by comparing with
manual annotation. Moreover, using these labels for distant supervision, we
demonstrate competitive model performance on the same data as models trained on
manual annotations. As such, we offer a cheap, extensible, and fast alternative
that can be employed beyond the task of gender classification.
