Abstract#==#In this research we investigate the impact of mismatches in the density and
type of error between training and test data on a neural system correcting
preposition and determiner errors. We use synthetically produced training data
to control error density and type, and "real" error data for testing. Our
results show it is possible to combine error types, although prepositions and
determiners behave differently in terms of how much error should be
artificially introduced into the training data in order to get the best
results.
