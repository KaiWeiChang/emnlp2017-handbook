Abstract#==#Technical documents contain a fair amount of unnatural language, such as
tables, formulas, and pseudo-code. Unnatural language can bean important factor
of confusing existing NLP tools. This paper presents an effective method of
distinguishing unnatural language from natural language, and evaluates the
impact of un-natural language detection on NLP tasks such as document
clustering.  We view this problem as an information extraction task and build a
multiclass classification model identifying unnatural language components into
four categories. First, we create a new annotated corpus by collecting slides
and papers in various for-mats, PPT, PDF, and HTML, where unnatural language
components are annotated into four categories. We then explore features
available from plain text to build a statistical model that can handle any
format as long as it is converted into plain text. Our experiments show that
re-moving unnatural language components gives an absolute improvement in
document cluster-ing by up to 15%.   Our corpus and tool are publicly available
