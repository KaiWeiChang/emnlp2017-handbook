Abstract#==#This submission describes the development of a fine-grained, text-chunking
algorithm for the task of comprehensive MWE segmentation. This task notably
focuses on the identification of colloquial and idiomatic language. The
submission also includes a thorough model evaluation in the context of two
recent shared tasks, spanning 19 different languages and many text domains,
including noisy, user-generated text. Evaluations exhibit the presented model
as the best overall for purposes of MWE segmentation, and open-source software
is released with the submission (although links are withheld for purposes of
anonymity). Additionally, the authors acknowledge the existence of a pre-print
document on arxiv.org, which should be avoided to maintain anonymity in review.
