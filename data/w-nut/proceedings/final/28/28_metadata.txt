Abstract#==#In this paper, we describe the Lithium Natural Language Processing (NLP) system
- a resource-constrained, high- throughput and language-agnostic system for
information extraction from noisy user generated text on social media. Lithium
NLP extracts a rich set of information including entities, top- ics, hashtags
and sentiment from text. We discuss several real world applications of the
system currently incorporated in Lithium products. We also compare our system
with existing commercial and academic NLP systems in terms of performance,
information extracted and languages supported. We show that Lithium NLP is at
par with and in some cases, outperforms state- of-the-art commercial NLP
systems.
