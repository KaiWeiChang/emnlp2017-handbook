Abstract#==#In this paper, we present our multi-channel neural architecture for recognizing
emerging named entity in social media messages, which we applied in the Novel
and Emerging Named Entity Recognition shared task at the EMNLP 2017 Workshop on
Noisy User-generated Text (W-NUT). We propose a novel approach, which
incorporates comprehensive word representations with multi-channel information
and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) into a traditional Bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network without using any additional
hand-craft features such as gazetteers. In comparison with other systems
participating in the shared task, our system won the 2nd place.
