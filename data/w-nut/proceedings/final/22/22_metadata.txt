Abstract#==#While language identification works well on standard texts, it performs much
worse on social media language, in particular dialectal language---even for
English. First, to support work on English language identification, we
contribute a new dataset of tweets annotated for English versus non-English,
with attention to ambiguity, code-switching, and automatic generation issues.
It is randomly sampled from all public messages, avoiding biases towards
pre-existing language classifiers. Second, we find that a demographic language
model---which identifies messages with language similar to that used by several
U.S. ethnic populations on Twitter---can be used to improve English language
identification performance when combined with a traditional supervised language
identifier. It increases recall with almost no loss of precision, including,
surprisingly, for English messages written by non-U.S. authors.
Our dataset and identifier ensemble are available online.
