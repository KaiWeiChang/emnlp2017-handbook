Abstract#==#This paper reports our participation in the W-NUT 2017 shared task on emerging
and rare entity recognition from user generated noisy text such as tweets,
online reviews and forum discussions. To accomplish this challenging task, we
explore an approach that combines LDA topic modelling with deep learning on
word level and character level embeddings. The LDA topic modelling generates
topic representation for each tweet which is used as a feature for each word in
the tweet. The deep learning component consists of two-layer bidirectional LSTM
and a CRF output layer. Our submitted result performed at 39.98 (F1) on entity
and 37.77 on surface forms. Our new experiments after submission reached a best
performance of 41.81 on entity and 40.57 on surface forms.
