Abstract#==#Videogame streaming platforms have become a paramount example of noisy
user-generated text. These are websites where gaming is broadcasted, and allows
interaction with viewers via integrated chatrooms. Probably the best known
platform of this kind is Twitch, which has more than 100 million monthly
viewers. Despite these numbers, and unlike other platforms featuring short
messages (e.g. Twitter), Twitch has not received much attention from the
Natural Language Processing community. In this paper we aim at bridging this
gap by proposing two important tasks specific to the Twitch platform, namely
(1) Emote prediction; and (2) Trolling detection. In our experiments, we
evaluate three models: a BOW baseline, a logistic supervised classifiers based
on word embeddings, and a bidirectional long short-term memory recurrent neural
network (LSTM). Our results show that the LSTM model outperforms the other two
models, where explicit features with proven effectiveness for similar tasks
were encoded.
