Abstract#==#We present our system for the WNUT 2017 Named Entity Recognition challenge on
Twitter data. We describe two modifications of a basic neural network
architecture for sequence tagging. First, we show how we exploit additional
labeled data, where the Named Entity tags differ from the target task. Then, we
propose a way to incorporate sentence level features. Our system uses both
methods and ranked second for entity level annotations, achieving an F1-score
of 40.78, and second for surface form annotations, achieving an F1-score of
39.33.
