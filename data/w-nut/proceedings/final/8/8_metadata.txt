Abstract#==#Human trafficking is a challenging law enforcement problem, and traces of
victims of such activity manifest as ‘escort advertisements’ on various
online forums. Given the large, heterogeneous and noisy structure of this data,
building models to predict instances of trafficking is a convoluted task. In
this paper we propose an entity resolution pipeline using a notion of proxy
labels, in order to extract clusters from this data with prior history of human
trafficking activity. We apply this pipeline to 5M records from backpage.com
and report on the performance of this approach, challenges in terms of
scalability, and some significant domain specific characteristics of our
resolved entities.
