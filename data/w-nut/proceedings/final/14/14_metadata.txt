Abstract#==#Uyghur is the second largest and most actively used social media language in
China. However, a non-negligible part of Uyghur text appearing in social media
is unsystematically written with the Latin alphabet, and it continues to
increase in size. Uyghur text in this format is incomprehensible and ambiguous
even to native Uyghur speakers. In addition, Uyghur texts in this form lack the
potential for any kind of advancement for the NLP tasks related to the Uyghur
language. Restoring and preventing noisy Uyghur text written with unsystematic
Latin alphabets will be essential to the protection of Uyghur language and
improving the accuracy of Uyghur NLP tasks. To this purpose, in this work we
propose and compare the noisy channel model and the neural encoder-decoder
model as normalizing methods.
