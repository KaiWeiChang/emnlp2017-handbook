Abstract#==#In certain fields, real-time knowledge from events can help in making informed
decisions. In order to extract pertinent real-time knowledge related to an
event, it is important to identify the named entities and their corresponding
aliases related to the event. The problem of identifying aliases of named
entities that spike has remained unexplored. In this paper, we introduce an
algorithm, EntitySpike, that identifies entities that spike in popularity in
tweets from a given time period, and constructs an alias list for these spiked
entities. EntitySpike uses a temporal heuristic to identify named entities with
similar context that occur in the same time period (within minutes) during an
event. Each entity is encoded as a vector using this temporal heuristic. We
show how these entity-vectors can be used to create a named entity alias list. 
We evaluated our algorithm on a dataset of temporally ordered tweets from a
single event, the 2013 Grammy Awards show. We carried out various experiments
on tweets that were published in the same time period and show that our
algorithm identifies most entity name aliases and outperforms a competitive
baseline.
