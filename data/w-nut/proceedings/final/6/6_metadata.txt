Abstract#==#For brands, gaining new customer is more expensive than keeping an existing
one. Therefore, the ability to keep customers in a brand is becoming more
challenging these days.  Churn happens when a customer leaves a brand to
another competitor. Most of the previous work considers the problem of churn
prediction using the Call Detail Records (CDRs). In this paper, we use
micro-posts to classify customers into churny or non-churny. We explore the
power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) since they achieved
state-of-the-art in various computer vision and NLP applications. However, the
robustness of end-to-end models has some limitations such as the availability
of a large amount of labeled data and uninterpretability of these models. We
investigate the use of CNNs augmented with structured logic rules to overcome
or reduce this issue. We developed our system called Churn_teacher by using an
iterative distillation method that transfers the knowledge, extracted using
just the combination of three logic rules, directly into the weight of the
DNNs. Furthermore, we used weight normalization to speed up training our
convolutional neural networks. Experimental results showed that with just these
three rules, we were able to get state-of-the-art on publicly available Twitter
dataset about three Telecom brands.
