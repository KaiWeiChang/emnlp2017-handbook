Abstract#==#Recent work in geolocation has made several hypotheses about what linguistic
markers are relevant to detect where people write from. In this paper, we
examine six hypotheses against a corpus consisting of all geo-tagged tweets
from the
US, or whose geo-tags could be inferred, in a 19% sample of Twitter history.
Our
experiments lend support to all six hypotheses, including that spelling
variants
and hashtags are strong predictors of location. We also study what kinds of
common nouns are predictive of location after controlling for named entities
such as dolphins or sharks
