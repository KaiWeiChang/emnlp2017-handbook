Abstract#==#Low-dimensional vector representations of social media users can benefit
applications like recommendation systems and user attribute inference. Recent
work has shown that user embeddings can be improved by combining different
types of information, such as text and network data. We propose a data
augmentation method that allows novel feature types to be used within
off-the-shelf embedding models. Experimenting with the task of friend
recommendation on a dataset of 5,019 Twitter users, we show that our approach
can lead to substantial performance gains with the simple addition of network
and geographic features.
