Abstract#==#This paper offers a comparative analysis of the performance of different
supervised machine learning methods and feature sets on argument mining tasks.
Specifically, we address the tasks of extracting argumentative segments from
texts and predicting the structure between those segments. Eight classifiers
and different combinations of six feature types reported in previous work are
evaluated. The results indicate that overall best performing features are the
structural ones. Although the performance of classifiers varies depending on
the feature combinations and corpora used for training and testing, Random
Forest seems to be among the best performing classifiers. These results build a
basis for further development of argument mining techniques and can guide an
implementation of argument mining into different applications such as argument
based search.
