Abstract#==#Stance classification is a core component in on-demand argument construction
pipelines. Previous work on claim stance classification relied on background
knowledge such as manually-composed sentiment lexicons. We show that both
accuracy and coverage can be significantly improved through automatic expansion
of the initial lexicon. We also developed a set of contextual features that
further improves the state-of-the-art for this task.
