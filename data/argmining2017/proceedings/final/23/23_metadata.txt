Abstract#==#In this paper we consider the insights that can be gained by considering large
scale argument networks and the complex interactions between their constituent
propositions. We investigate metrics for analysing properties of these
networks, illustrating these using a corpus of arguments taken from the 2016 US
Presidential Debates. We present techniques for determining these features
directly from natural language text and show that there is a strong correlation
between these automatically identified features and the argumentative structure
contained within the text. Finally, we combine these metrics with argument
mining techniques and show how the identification of argumentative relations
can be improved by considering the larger context in which they occur.
