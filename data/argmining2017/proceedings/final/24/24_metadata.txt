Abstract#==#This paper presents a method of extracting argumentative structure from natural
language text. The approach presented is based on the way in which we
understand an argument being made, not just from the words said, but from
existing contextual knowledge and understanding of the broader issues. We
leverage high-precision, low-recall techniques in order to automatically build
a large corpus of inferential statements related to the text's topic. These
statements are then used to produce a matrix representing the inferential
relationship between different aspects of the topic. From this matrix, we are
able to determine connectedness and directionality of inference between
statements in the original text. By following this approach, we obtain results
that compare favourably to those of other similar techniques to classify
premise-conclusion pairs (with results 22 points above baseline), but without
the requirement of large volumes of annotated, domain specific data.
