Abstract#==#Argumentative corpora are costly to create and are available in only few
languages with English dominating the area. In this paper we release the first
publicly available Mandarin argumentative corpus. The corpus is created by
exploiting the idea of comparable corpora from Statistical Machine Translation.
We use existing corpora in English and manually map the claims and premises to
comparable corpora in Mandarin. We also implement a simple solution to automate
this approach with the view of creating argumentative corpora in other
less-resourced languages. In this way we introduce a new task of multi-lingual
argument mapping that can be evaluated using our English-Mandarin argumentative
corpus. The preliminary results of our automatic argument mapper mirror the
simplicity of our approach, but provide a baseline for further improvements.
