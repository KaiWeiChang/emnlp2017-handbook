Abstract#==#In this paper we present a new unsupervised approach, “Attraction to
Topics” –
A2T , for the detection of argumentative units, a sub-task of argument mining.
Motivated by the importance of topic identification in manual annotation, we
examine whether topic modeling can be used for performing unsupervised
detection of argumentative sentences, and to what extend topic modeling can be
used to classify sentences as claims and premises.
Preliminary evaluation results suggest that topic information can be
successfully used for the detection of argumentative sentences, at least for
corpora used for evaluation.
Our approach has been evaluated on two English corpora, the first of which
contains 90 persuasive essays, while the second is a collection of 340
documents from user generated content.
