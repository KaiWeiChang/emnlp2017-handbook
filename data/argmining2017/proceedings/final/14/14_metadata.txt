Abstract#==#Automatic claim detection is a fundamental
argument mining task that aims to automatically
mine claims regarding a topic
of consideration. Previous works on mining
argumentative content have assumed
that a set of relevant documents is given in
advance. Here, we present a first corpus–
wide claim detection framework, that can
be directly applied to massive corpora.
Using simple and intuitive empirical observations,
we derive a claim sentence
query by which we are able to directly retrieve
sentences in which the prior probability
to include topic-relevant claims is
greatly enhanced. Next, we employ simple
heuristics to rank the sentences, leading
to an unsupervised corpus–wide claim detection
system, with precision that outperforms
previously reported results on the
task of claim detection given relevant documents
and labeled data.
