Abstract#==#The segmentation of an argumentative text into argument units and their
non-argumentative counterparts is the first step in identifying the
argumentative structure of the text. Despite its importance for argument
mining, unit segmentation has been approached only sporadically so far. This
paper studies the major parameters of unit segmentation systematically. We
explore the effectiveness of various features, when capturing words separately,
along with their neighbors, or even along with the entire text. Each such
context is reflected by one machine learning model that we evaluate within and
across three domains of texts. Among the models, our new deep learning approach
capturing the entire text turns out best within all domains, with an F-score of
up to 88.54. While structural features generalize best across domains, the
domain transfer remains hard, which points to major challenges of unit
segmentation.
