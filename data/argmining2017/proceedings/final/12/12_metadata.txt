Abstract#==#This paper describes a pilot study to evaluate human analystsâ€™ ability to
identify the argumentation scheme and premises of an argument having an
implicit conclusion.  In preparation for the study, argumentation scheme
definitions were crafted for genetics research articles.  The schemes were
defined in semantic terms, following a proposal to use semantic rules to mine
arguments in that literature.
