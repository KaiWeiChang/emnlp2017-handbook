Abstract#==#High quality classroom discussion is important to student development,
enhancing
abilities to express claims, reason about other studentsâ€™ claims, and retain
information for longer periods of time. Previous small-scale studies have shown
that one indicator of classroom discussion quality is specificity. In this
paper we tackle the problem of predicting specificity for classroom
discussions. We propose several methods and feature sets capable of
outperforming the state of the art in specificity prediction. Additionally, we
provide a set of meaningful, interpretable features that can be used to analyze
classroom discussions at a pedagogical level.
