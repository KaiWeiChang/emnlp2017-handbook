Abstract#==#We present the CIC-FBK system, which took part in the Native Language
Identification (NLI) Shared Task 2017. Our approach combines features commonly
used in previous NLI research, i.e., word n-grams, lemma n-grams,
part-of-speech n-grams, and function words, with recently introduced character
n-grams from misspelled words, and features that are novel in this task, such
as typed character n-grams, and syntactic n-grams of words and of syntactic
relation tags. We use log-entropy weighting scheme and perform classification
using the Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm. Our system achieved 0.8808
macro-averaged F1-score and shared the 1st rank in the NLI Shared Task 2017
scoring.
