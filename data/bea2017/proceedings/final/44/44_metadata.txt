Abstract#==#We present a very simple model for text quality assessment based on a deep
convolutional neural network, where the only supervision required is one corpus
of user-generated text of varying quality, and one contrasting text corpus of
consistently high quality. Our model is able to provide local quality
assessments in different parts of a text, which allows visual feedback about
where potentially problematic parts of the text are located, as well as a way
to evaluate which textual features are captured by our model. We evaluate our
method on two corpora: a large corpus of manually graded student essays and a
longitudinal corpus of language learner written production, and find that the
text quality metric learned by our model is a fairly strong predictor of both
essay grade and learner proficiency level.
