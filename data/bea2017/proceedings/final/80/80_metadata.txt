Abstract#==#In this paper, we discuss the results of the IUCL system in the NLI Shared Task
2017. For our system, we explore a variety of phonetic algorithms to generate
features for Native Language Identification. These features are contrasted with
one of the most successful type of features in NLI, character n-grams. We find
that although phonetic features do not perform as well as character n-grams
alone, they do increase overall F1 score when used together with character
n-grams.
