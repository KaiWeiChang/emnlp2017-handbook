Abstract#==#We build a grammatical error correction (GEC) system primarily based on the
state-of-the-art statistical machine translation (SMT) approach, using
task-specific features and tuning, and further enhance it with the modeling
power of neural network joint models. The SMT-based system is weak in
generalizing beyond patterns seen during training and lacks granularity below
the word level. To address this issue, we incorporate a character-level SMT
component targeting the misspelled words that the original SMT-based system
fails to correct. Our final system achieves 53.14% F 0.5 score on the benchmark
CoNLL-2014 test set, an improvement of 3.62% F 0.5 over the best previous
published score.
