Abstract#==#We present the RUG-SU team's submission at the Native Language Identification
Shared Task 2017.
We combine several approaches into an ensemble, based on spelling error
features, a simple neural network using word representations, a deep residual
network using word and character features, and a system based on a recurrent
neural network. 
Our best system is an ensemble of neural networks, reaching an F1 score of
0.8323.
Although our system is not the highest ranking one, we do outperform the
baseline by far.
