Abstract#==#Writing is a challenge, especially for at-risk students who may lack the
prerequisite writing skills required to persist in U.S. 4-year postsecondary
(college) institutions. Educators teaching postsecondary courses requiring
writing could benefit from a better understanding of writing achievement and
its role in postsecondary success. In this paper, novel exploratory work
examined how automated writing evaluation (AWE) can inform our understanding of
the relationship between postsecondary writing skill and broader success
outcomes. An exploratory study was conducted using test-taker essays from a
standardized writing assessment of postsecondary student learning outcomes.
Findings showed that for the essays, AWE features were found to be predictors
of broader outcomes measures: college success and learning outcomes measures.
Study findings illustrate AWE’s potential to support educational analytics --
i.e., relationships between writing skill and broader outcomes – taking a
step toward moving AWE beyond writing assessment and instructional use cases.
