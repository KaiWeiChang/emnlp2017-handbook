Abstract#==#This paper proposes a deep-learning based native-language identification (NLI)
using a latent semantic analysis (LSA) as a participant (ETRI-SLP) of the NLI
Shared Task 2017 where the NLI Shared Task 2017 aims to detect the native
language of an essay or speech response of a standardized assessment of English
proficiency for academic purposes. To this end, we use the six unit forms of a
text data such as character 4/5/6-grams and word 1/2/3-grams. For each unit
form of text data, we convert it into a count-based vector, extract a 2000-rank
LSA feature, and perform a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) based dimension
reduction. From the count-based vector or the LSA-LDA feature, we also obtain
the output prediction values of a support vector machine (SVM) based
classifier, the output prediction values of a deep neural network (DNN) based
classifier, and the bottleneck values of a DNN based classifier. In order to
incorporate the various kinds of text-based features and a speech-based
i-vector feature, we design two DNN based ensemble classifiers for late fusion
and early fusion, respectively. From the NLI experiments, the F1 (macro) scores
are obtained as 0.8601, 0.8664, and 0.9220 for the essay track, the speech
track, and the fusion track, respectively. The proposed method has comparable
performance to the top-ranked teams for the speech and fusion tracks, although
it has slightly lower performance for the essay track.
