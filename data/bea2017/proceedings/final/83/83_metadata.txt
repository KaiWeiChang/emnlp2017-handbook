Abstract#==#In this paper, we describe the approach of the ItaliaNLP Lab team to native
language identification and discuss the results we submitted as participants to
the essay track of NLI Shared Task 2017. We introduce for the first time a
2-stacked sentence-document architecture for native language identification
that is able to exploit both local sentence information and a wide set of
general-purpose features qualifying the lexical and grammatical structure of
the whole document. When evaluated on the official test set, our
sentence-document stacked architecture obtained the best result among all the
participants of the essay track with an F1 score of 0.8818.
