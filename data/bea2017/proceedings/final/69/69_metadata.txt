Abstract#==#Our team—Uvic-NLP—explored and evaluated a variety of lexical features for
Native Language Identification (NLI) within the framework of ensemble methods.
Using a subset of the highest performing features, we train Support Vector
Machines (SVM) and Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN) as base classifiers,
and test different methods for combining their outputs. Restricting our scope
to the closed essay track in the NLI Shared Task 2017, we find that our best
SVM ensemble achieves an F1 score of 0.8730 on the test set.
