Abstract#==#The field of grammatical error correction (GEC) has made tremendous bounds in
the last ten years, but new questions and obstacles are revealing themselves.
In this position paper, we discuss the issues that need to be addressed and
provide recommendations for the field to continue to make progress, and propose
a new shared task. We invite suggestions and critiques from the audience to
make the new shared task a community-driven venture.
