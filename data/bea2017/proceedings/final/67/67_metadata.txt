Abstract#==#We summarize the involvement of our CEMI team in the ''NLI Shared Task 2017'',
which deals with both textual and speech input data. We submitted the results
achieved by using three different system architectures; each of them combines
multiple supervised learning models trained on various feature sets. As
expected, better results are achieved with the systems that use both the
textual data and the spoken responses. Combining the input data of two
different modalities led to a rather dramatic improvement in classification
performance. 
Our best performing method is based on a set of feed-forward neural networks
whose hidden-layer outputs are combined together using a softmax layer. We
achieved a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.9257 on the evaluation (unseen) test
set and our team placed first in the main task together with other three teams.
