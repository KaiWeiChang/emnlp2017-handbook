Abstract#==#We explore various supervised learning strategies for automated scoring of
content knowledge for a large corpus of 130 different content-based questions
spanning four subject areas (Science, Math, English Language Arts, and Social
Studies) and containing over 230,000 responses scored by human raters. Based on
our analyses, we provide specific recommendations for content scoring. These
are based on patterns observed across multiple questions and assessments and
are, therefore, likely to generalize to other scenarios and prove useful to the
community as automated content scoring becomes more popular in schools and
classrooms.
