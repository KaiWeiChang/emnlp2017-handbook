Abstract#==#Native language identification (NLI) is the task of determining an author's
native language, based on a piece of his/her writing in a second language. In
recent years, NLI has received much attention due to its challenging nature and
its applications in language pedagogy and forensic linguistics. We participated
in the NLI2017 shared task under the name UT-DSP. In our effort to implement a
method for native language identification, we made use of a fusion of character
and word N-grams, and achieved an optimal F1-Score of 77.64\%, using both essay
and speech transcription datasets.
