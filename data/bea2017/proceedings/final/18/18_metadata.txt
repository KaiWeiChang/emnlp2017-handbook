Abstract#==#We present crowdsourced collection of error annotations for transcriptions of
spoken learner English. Our emphasis in data collection is on fluency
corrections, a more complete correction than has traditionally been aimed for
in grammatical error correction research (GEC). Fluency corrections require
improvements to the text, taking discourse and utterance level semantics into
account: the result is a more naturalistic, holistic version of the original.
We propose that this shifted emphasis be reflected in a new name for the task:
'holistic error correction' (HEC). We analyse crowdworker behaviour in HEC and
conclude that the method is useful with certain amendments for future work.
