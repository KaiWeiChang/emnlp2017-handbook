Abstract#==#Ontologies provide a structured representation of concepts and the
relationships which connect them. This work investigates how a pre-existing
educational Biology ontology can be used to generate useful practice questions
for students by using the connectivity structure in a novel way. It also
introduces a novel way to generate multiple-choice distractors from the
ontology, and compares this to a baseline of using embedding representations of
nodes. An assessment by an experienced science teacher shows a significant
advantage over a baseline when using the ontology for distractor generation. A
subsequent study with three science teachers on the results of a modified
question generation algorithm finds significant improvements. An in-depth
analysis of the teachersâ€™ comments yields useful insights for any researcher
working on automated question generation for educational applications.
