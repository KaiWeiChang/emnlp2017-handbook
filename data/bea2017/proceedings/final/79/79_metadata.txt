Abstract#==#This paper presents an ensemble system combining the output of multiple SVM
classifiers to native language identification (NLI). The system was submitted
to the NLI Shared Task 2017 fusion track which featured students essays and
spoken responses in form of audio transcriptions and iVectors by non-native
English speakers of eleven native languages. Our system competed in the
challenge under the team name ZCD and was based on an ensemble of SVM
classifiers trained on character n-grams achieving 83.58% accuracy and ranking
3rd in the shared task.
