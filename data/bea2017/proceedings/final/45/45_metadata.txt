Abstract#==#Shortage of available training data is holding back progress in the area of
automated error detection.
This paper investigates two alternative methods for artificially generating
writing errors, in order to create additional resources.
We propose treating error generation as a machine translation task, where
grammatically correct text is translated to contain errors.
In addition, we explore a system for extracting textual patterns from an
annotated corpus, which can then be used to insert errors into grammatically
correct sentences.
Our experiments show that the inclusion of artificially generated errors
significantly improves error detection accuracy on both FCE and CoNLL 2014
datasets.
