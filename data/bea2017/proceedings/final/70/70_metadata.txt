Abstract#==#We describe a machine learning approach for the 2017 shared task on Native
Language Identification (NLI). The proposed approach combines several kernels
using multiple kernel learning. While most of our kernels are based on
character p-grams (also known as n-grams) extracted from essays or speech
transcripts, we also use a kernel based on i-vectors, a low-dimensional
representation of audio recordings, provided by the shared task organizers. For
the learning stage, we choose Kernel Discriminant Analysis (KDA) over Kernel
Ridge Regression (KRR), because the former classifier obtains better results
than the latter one on the development set. In our previous work, we have used
a similar machine learning approach to achieve state-of-the-art NLI results.
The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that our shallow and simple approach
based on string kernels (with minor improvements) can pass the test of time and
reach state-of-the-art performance in the 2017 NLI shared task, despite the
recent advances in natural language processing. We participated in all three
tracks, in which the competitors were allowed to use only the essays (essay
track), only the speech transcripts (speech track), or both (fusion track).
Using only the data provided by the organizers for training our models, we have
reached a macro F1 score of 86.95% in the closed essay track, a macro F1 score
of 87.55% in the closed speech track, and a macro F1 score of 93.19% in the
closed fusion track. With these scores, our team (UnibucKernel) ranked in the
first group of teams in all three tracks, while attaining the best scores in
the speech and the fusion tracks.
