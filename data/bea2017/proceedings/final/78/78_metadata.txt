Abstract#==#This paper reports our contribution (team WLZ) to the NLI Shared Task 2017
(essay track). We first extract lexical and syntactic features from the essays,
perform feature weighting and selection, and train linear support vector
machine (SVM) classifiers each on an individual feature type. The output of
base classifiers, as probabilities for each class, are then fed into a
multilayer perceptron to predict the native language of the author. We also
report the performance of each feature type, as well as the best features of a
type. Our system achieves an accuracy of 86.55%, which is among the best
performing systems of this shared task.
