Abstract#==#The paper presents first results of an ongoing project on text
simplification focusing on linguistic metaphors. Based on an analysis
of a parallel corpus of news text professionally simplified for
different grade levels, we identify six types of simplification
choices falling into two broad categories: preserving metaphors or
dropping them. An annotation study on almost 300 source sentences with
metaphors (grade level 12) and their simplified counterparts (grade~4)
is conducted. The results show that most metaphors are preserved and
when they are dropped, the semantic content tends to be preserved
rather than dropped, however, it is reworded without metaphorical
language. In general, some of the expected tendencies in complexity
reduction, measured with psycholinguistic variables linked to metaphor
comprehension, are observed, suggesting good prospect for machine
learning-based metaphor simplification.
