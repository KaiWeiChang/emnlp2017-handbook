Abstract#==#NLP applications for learners often rely on annotated learner corpora. Thereby,
it is important that the annotations are both meaningful for the task, and
consistent and reliable. We present a new longitudinal L1 learner corpus for
German (handwritten texts collected in grade 2--4), which is transcribed and
annotated with a target hypothesis that strictly only corrects orthographic
errors, and is thereby tailored to research and tool development for
orthographic issues in primary school. While for most corpora, transcription
and target hypothesis are not evaluated, we conducted a detailed
inter-annotator agreement study for both tasks. Although we achieved high
agreement, our discussion of cases of disagreement shows that even with
detailed guidelines, annotators differ here and there for different reasons,
which should also be considered when working with transcriptions and target
hypotheses of other corpora, especially if no explicit guidelines for their
construction are known.
