Abstract#==#Flashcard systems are effective tools for learning words but have their
limitations in teaching word usage. To overcome this problem, we propose a
novel flashcard system that 
shows a new example sentence on each repetition. This extension requires
high-quality example sentences, automatically extracted from a huge corpus. To
do this, we use a Determinantal Point Process which scales well to large data
and allows to naturally represent sentence similarity and quality as features.
Our human evaluation experiment on Japanese language indicates that the
proposed method successfully extracted high-quality example sentences.
