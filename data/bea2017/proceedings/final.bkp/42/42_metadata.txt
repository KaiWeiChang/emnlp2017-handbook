Abstract#==#Learners need to find suitable documents to read and prioritize them in an
appropriate order. We present a method of automatically generating reading
lists, selecting documents based on their pedagogical value to the learner and
ordering them using the structure of concepts in the domain. Resulting reading
lists related to computational linguistics were evaluated by advanced learners
and judged to be near the quality of those generated by domain experts. We
provide an open-source implementation of our method to enable future work on
reading list generation.
