Abstract#==#Public speakings play important roles in schools and work places and properly
using humor contributes to effective presentations. For the purpose of
automatically evaluating speakers' humor usage, we build a presentation corpus
containing humorous utterances based on TED talks. Compared to previous data
resources supporting humor recognition research, ours has several advantages,
including (a) both positive and negative instances coming from a homogeneous
data set, (b) containing a large number of speakers, and (c) being open.
Focusing on using lexical cues for humor recognition, we systematically compare
a newly emerging text classification method based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) with a well-established conventional method using linguistic
knowledge. The advantages of the CNN method are both getting higher detection
accuracies and being able to learn essential features automatically.
