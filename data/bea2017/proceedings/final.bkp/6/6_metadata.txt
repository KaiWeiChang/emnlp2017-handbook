Abstract#==#We show that text readability prediction improves significantly from hard
parameter sharing with models predicting first pass duration, total fixation
duration and regression duration. Specifically, we induce multi-task Multilayer
Perceptrons and Logistic Regression models over sentence representations that
capture various aggregate statistics, from two different text readability
corpora for English, as well as the Dundee eye-tracking corpus. Our approach
leads to significant improvements over Single task learning and over previous
systems. In addition, our improvements are consistent across train sample
sizes, making our approach especially applicable to small datasets.
