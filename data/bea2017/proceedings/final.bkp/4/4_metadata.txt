Abstract#==#Question difficulty estimates guide test creation, but are too costly for
small-scale testing. We empirically verify that Bloom's Taxonomy, a standard
tool for difficulty estimation during question creation, reliably predicts
question difficulty observed after testing in a short-answer corpus. We also
find that difficulty is mirrored in the amount of variation in student answers,
which can be computed before grading.

We show that question difficulty and its approximations are useful for
\textit{automated grading}, allowing us to identify the optimal feature set for
grading each question even in an unseen-question setting.
