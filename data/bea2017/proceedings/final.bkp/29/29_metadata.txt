Abstract#==#This paper reports the first study on automatic generation of distractors for
fill-in-the-blank items for learning Chinese vocabulary.  We investigate the
quality of distractors generated by a number of criteria, including
part-of-speech, difficulty level, spelling, word co-occurrence and semantic
similarity.  Evaluations show that a semantic similarity measure, based on the
word2vec model, yields distractors that are significantly more plausible than
those generated by baseline methods.
