Abstract#==#This study provides a detailed analysis of evaluation of English pronoun
reference questions which are created automatically by machine. Pronoun
reference questions are multiple choice questions that ask test takers to
choose an antecedent of a target pronoun in a reading passage from four
options. The evaluation was performed from two perspectives: the perspective of
English teachers and that of English learners. Item analysis suggests that
machine-generated questions achieve comparable quality with human-made
questions. Correlation analysis revealed a strong correlation between the
scores of machine-generated questions and that of human-made questions.
