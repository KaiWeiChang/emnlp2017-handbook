Abstract#==#In this paper we describe the approaches we explored for the 2017 Native
Language Identification shared task. We focused on simple word and sub-word
units avoiding heavy use of hand-crafted features. Following recent trends, we
explored linear and neural networks models to attempt to compensate for the
lack of rich feature use. Initial efforts yielded f1-scores of 82.39% and
83.77% in the development and test sets of the fusion track, and were
officially submitted to the task as team L2F. After the task was closed, we
carried on further experiments and relied on a late fusion strategy for
combining our simple proposed approaches with modifications of the baselines
provided by the task. As expected, the i-vectors based sub-system dominates the
performance of the system combinations, and results in the major contributor to
our achieved scores. Our best combined system achieves 90.1% and 90.2% f1-score
in the development and test sets of the fusion track, respectively.
