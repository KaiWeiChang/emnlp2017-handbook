Abstract#==#Automatic essay scoring is nowadays successfully used even in high-stakes
tests, but this is mainly limited to holistic scoring of learner essays.
We present a new dataset of essays written by highly proficient German native
speakers that is scored using a fine-grained rubric with the goal to provide
detailed feedback.
Our experiments with two state-of-the-art scoring systems (a neural and a
SVM-based one)                                show a large drop in performance
compared to
existing
datasets.
This demonstrates the need for such datasets that allow to guide research on
more elaborate essay scoring methods.
