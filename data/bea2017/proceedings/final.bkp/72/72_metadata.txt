Abstract#==#We report on our experiments with N-gram and embedding based feature
representations for Native Language Identification (NLI) as a part of the NLI
Shared Task 2017 (team name: NLI-ISU). Our best performing system on the test
set for written essays had a macro F1 of 0.8264 and was based on word uni, bi
and trigram features. We explored n-grams covering word, character, POS and
word-POS mixed representations for this task. For embedding based feature
representations, we employed both word and document embeddings. We had a
relatively poor performance with all embedding representations compared to
n-grams, which could be because of the fact that embeddings capture semantic
similarities whereas L1 differences are more stylistic in nature.
