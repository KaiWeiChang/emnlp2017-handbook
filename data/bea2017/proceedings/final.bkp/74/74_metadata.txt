Abstract#==#This paper describes our results at the NLI shared task 2017.  We participated
in essays, speech, and fusion task that uses text, speech, and i-vectors for
the task of identifying the native language of the given input. In the essay
track, a linear SVM system using word bigrams and character 7-grams performed
the best. In the speech track, an LDA classifier based only on i-vectors
performed better than a combination system using text features from speech
transcriptions and i-vectors. In the fusion task, we experimented with systems
that used combination of i-vectors with higher order n-grams features,
combination of i-vectors with word unigrams, a mean probability ensemble, and a
stacked ensemble system. Our finding is that word unigrams in combination with
i-vectors achieve higher score than systems trained with larger number of
\emph{n}-gram features.  Our best-performing systems achieved F1-scores of
87.16%, 83.33% and 91.75% on the essay track, the speech track and the fusion
track respectively.
