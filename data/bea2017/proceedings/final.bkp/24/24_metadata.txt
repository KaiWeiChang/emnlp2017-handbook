Abstract#==#Given the lack of large user-evaluated corpora in disability-related NLP
research (e.g. text simplification or readability assessment for people with
cognitive disabilities), the question of choosing suitable training data for
NLP models is not straightforward. The use of large generic corpora may be
problematic because such data may not reflect the needs of the target
population. The use of the available user-evaluated corpora may be problematic
because these datasets are not large enough to be used as training data. In
this paper we explore a third approach, in which a large generic corpus is
combined with a smaller population-specific corpus to train a classifier which
is
evaluated using two sets of unseen user-evaluated data. One of these sets, the
ASD Comprehension corpus, is developed for the purposes of this study and made
freely available. We explore the effects of the size and type of the training
data used on the performance of the classifiers, and the effects of the type of
the unseen test datasets on the classification performance.
