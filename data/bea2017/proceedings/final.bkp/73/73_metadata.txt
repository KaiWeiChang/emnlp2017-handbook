Abstract#==#This paper describes the systems submitted by GadjahMada team to the Native
Language Identification (NLI) Shared Task 2017. Our models used a continuous
representation of character n-grams which are learned jointly with feed-forward
neural network classifier. Character n-grams have been proved to be effective
for style-based identification tasks including NLI. Results on the test set
demonstrate that the proposed model performs very well on essay and fusion
tracks by obtaining more than 0.8 on both F-macro score and accuracy.
