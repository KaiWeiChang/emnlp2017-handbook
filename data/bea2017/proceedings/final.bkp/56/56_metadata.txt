Abstract#==#For medical students, virtual patient dialogue systems can provide useful
training opportunities without the cost of employing actors to portray
standardized patients.              This work utilizes word- and
character-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for question
identification in a virtual
patient dialogue system, outperforming a strong word- and character-based
logistic regression baseline.  While the CNNs perform well given sufficient
training data, the best system performance is ultimately achieved by combining
CNNs with a hand-crafted pattern matching system that is robust to label
sparsity, providing a 10% boost in system accuracy and an error reduction of
47% as compared to the pattern-matching system alone.
