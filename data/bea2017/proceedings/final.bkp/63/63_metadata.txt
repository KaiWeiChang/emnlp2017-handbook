Abstract#==#Automated methods for essay scoring have made great progress in recent years,
achieving accuracies very close to human annotators. 
However, a known weakness of such automated scorers is not taking into account
the semantic relevance of the submitted text.
While there is existing work on detecting answer relevance given a textual
prompt, very little previous research has been done to incorporate visual
writing prompts.
We propose a neural architecture and several extensions for detecting off-topic
responses to visual prompts and evaluate it on a dataset of texts written by
language learners.
