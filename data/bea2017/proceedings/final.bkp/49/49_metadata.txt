Abstract#==#Knowledge of the association between assessment questions and the skills
required to solve them is necessary for analysis of student learning. This
association, often represented as a Q-matrix, is either hand-labeled by domain
experts or learned as latent variables given a large student response data set.
As a means of automating the match to formal standards, this paper uses neural
text classification methods, leveraging the language in the standards documents
to identify online text for a proxy training task. Experiments involve
identifying the topic and crosscutting concepts of middle school science
questions leveraging multi-task training. Results show that it is possible to
automatically build a Q-matrix without student response data and using a modest
number of hand-labeled questions.
