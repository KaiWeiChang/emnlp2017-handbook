Abstract#==#Using methods of statistical analysis, we investigate how semantic knowledge is
acquired in English as a second language and evaluate the pace of development
across a number of predicate types and content word combinations, as well as
across the levels of language proficiency and native languages. Our exploratory
study helps identify the most problematic areas for language learners with
different backgrounds and at different stages of learning.
