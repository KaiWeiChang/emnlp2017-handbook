Abstract#==#We describe the submissions entered by the National Research Council
Canada in the NLI-2017 evaluation. We mainly explored the use of
voting, and various ways to optimize the choice and number of voting
systems.  We also explored the use of features that rely on no
linguistic preprocessing. Long ngrams of characters obtained from raw
text turned out to yield the best performance on all textual input
(written essays and speech transcripts). Voting ensembles turned out
to produce small performance gains, with little difference between the
various optimization strategies we tried. Our top systems achieved
accuracies of 87% on the \essay\ track, 84% on the
\speech\ track, and close to 92% by combining essays, speech and
i-vectors in the \fusion\ track.
