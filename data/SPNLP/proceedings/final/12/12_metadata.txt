Abstract#==#Dependency parses are an effective way to inject linguistic knowledge into many
downstream tasks, and many practitioners wish to efficiently parse sentences at
scale. Recent advances in GPU hardware have enabled neural networks to achieve
significant gains over the previous best models, these models still fail to
leverage GPUs' capability for massive parallelism due to their requirement of
sequential processing of the sentence. In response, we propose Dilated Iterated
Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (DIG-CNNs) for
graph-based dependency parsing, a graph convolutional architecture that allows
for efficient end-to-end GPU parsing. In experiments on the English Penn
TreeBank benchmark, we show that DIG-CNNs perform on par with some of the best
neural network parsers.
