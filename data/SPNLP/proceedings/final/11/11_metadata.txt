Abstract#==#This work is on a previously formalized semantic evaluation task of spatial
role labeling (SpRL) that aims at extraction of formal spatial meaning from
text. Here, we report the results of initial efforts towards exploiting visual
information in the form of images to help spatial language understanding. We
discuss the way of designing new models in the framework of declarative
learning-based programming (DeLBP). The DeLBP framework facilitates combining
modalities and representing various data in a unified graph. 
  The learning and inference models exploit the structure of the unified graph
as well as the global first order domain constraints beyond the data to predict
the semantics which forms a structured meaning representation of the spatial
context. Continuous representations are used to relate the various elements of
the graph originating from different modalities. We improved over the
state-of-the-art results on SpRL.
