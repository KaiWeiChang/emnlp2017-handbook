Abstract#==#We present an algorithm for structured prediction under online bandit feedback.
The learner repeatedly predicts a sequence of actions, generating a structured
output. It then observes feedback for that output and no others. We consider
two cases: a pure bandit setting in which it only observes a loss, and more
fine-grained feedback in which it observes a loss for every action. We find
that the fine-grained feedback is necessary for strong empirical performance,
because it allows for a robust variance-reduction strategy. We empirically
compare a number of different algorithms and exploration methods and show the
efficacy of BLS on sequence labeling and dependency parsing tasks.
