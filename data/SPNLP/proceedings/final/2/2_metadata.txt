Abstract#==#Standard approaches in entity identification hard-code boundary detection and
type prediction into labels and perform Viterbi. This has two disadvantages: 1.
the runtime complexity grows quadratically in the number of types, and 2. there
is no natural segment-level representation. In this paper, we propose a neural
architecture that addresses these disadvantages. We frame the problem as
multitasking, separating boundary detection and type prediction but optimizing
them jointly. Despite its simplicity, this architecture performs competitively
with fully structured models such as BiLSTM-CRFs while scaling linearly in the
number of types. Furthermore, by construction, the model induces
type-disambiguating embeddings of predicted mentions.
