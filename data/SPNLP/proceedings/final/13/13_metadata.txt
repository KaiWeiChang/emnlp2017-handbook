Abstract#==#We present an architecture to boost the precision of existing information
extraction systems. This is achieved by augmenting the existing parser, which
may be constraint-based or hybrid statistical, with a character-level neural
network. Our architecture combines the ability of constraint-based or hybrid
extraction systems to easily incorporate domain knowledge with the ability of
deep neural networks to leverage large amounts of data to learn complex
features. The network is trained using a measure of consistency between
extracted data and existing databases as a form of cheap, noisy supervision.
Our architecture does not require large scale manual annotation or a system
rewrite. It has led to large precision improvements over an existing,
highly-tuned production information extraction system used at Bloomberg LP for
financial language text.
