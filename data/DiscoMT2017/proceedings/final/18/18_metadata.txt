Abstract#==#In this paper we present our systems for the DiscoMT 2017 cross-lingual pronoun
prediction shared task. For all four language pairs, we trained a standard
attention-based neural machine translation system as well as three variants
that incorporate information from the preceding source sentence. We show that
our systems, which are not specifically designed for pronoun prediction and may
be used to generate complete sentence translations, generally achieve
competitive results on this task.
