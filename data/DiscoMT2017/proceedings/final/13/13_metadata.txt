Abstract#==#We describe the Uppsala system for the 2017 DiscoMT shared task on
cross-lingual pronoun prediction. The system is based on a lower layer of
BiLSTMs reading the source and target sentences respectively. Classification is
based on the BiLSTM representation of the source and target positions for the
pronouns. In addition we enrich our system with dependency representations from
an external parser and character representations of the source sentence. We
show that these additions perform well for German and Spanish as source
languages. Our system is competitive and is in first or second place for all
language pairs.
