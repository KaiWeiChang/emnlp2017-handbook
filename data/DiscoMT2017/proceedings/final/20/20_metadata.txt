Abstract#==#Implicit discourse connectives and relations are distributed more widely in
Chinese texts, when translating into English, such connectives are usually
translated explicitly. Towards Chinese-English MT, in this paper we describe
cross-lingual annotation and alignment of dis-course connectives in a parallel
corpus, describing related surveys and findings. We then conduct some
evaluation experiments to testify the translation of implicit connectives and
whether representing implicit connectives explicitly in source language can
improve the final translation performance significantly. Preliminary results
show it has little improvement by just inserting explicit connectives for
implicit relations.
