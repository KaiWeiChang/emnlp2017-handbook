Abstract#==#We describe the design, the setup, and the evaluation results of the DiscoMT
2017 shared task on cross-lingual pronoun prediction. The task asked
participants to predict a target-language pronoun given a source-language
pronoun in the context of a sentence. We further provided a lemmatized
target-language human-authored translation of the source sentence, and
automatic word alignments between the source sentence words and the
target-language lemmata. The aim of the task was to predict, for each
target-language pronoun placeholder, the word that should replace it from a
small, closed set of classes, using any type of information that can be
extracted from the entire document. We offered four subtasks, each for a
different language pair and translation direction: English-to-French,
English-to-German, German-to-English, and Spanish-to-English. Five teams
participated in the shared task, making submissions for all language pairs. The
evaluation results show that most participating teams outperformed two strong
n-gram-based language model-based baseline systems by a sizable margin.
