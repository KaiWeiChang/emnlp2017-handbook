Abstract#==#Although coherence is an important aspect of any text generation system, it has
received little attention in the context of machine translation (MT) so far. 
We hypothesize that the quality of document-level translation can be improved
if MT models take into account the semantic relations among sentences during
translation. We integrate the graph-based coherence model proposed by Mesgar
and Strube, (2016) with Docent (Hardmeier et al., 2012, Hardmeier, 2014) a
document-level machine translation system. The application of this graph-based
coherence modeling approach is novel in the context of machine translation. We
evaluate the coherence model and its effects on the quality of the machine
translation. The result of our experiments shows that our coherence model
slightly improves the quality of translation in terms of the average Meteor
score.
