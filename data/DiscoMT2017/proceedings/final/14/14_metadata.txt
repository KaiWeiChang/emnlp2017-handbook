Abstract#==#In this paper, we analyse alignment discrepancies  for discourse structures in
English-German parallel data -- sentence pairs, in which discourse structures
in target or source texts have no alignment in the corresponding parallel
sentences. The discourse-related structures are designed in form of linguistic
patterns based on the information delivered by automatic part-of-speech and
dependency annotation. In addition to alignment errors (existing structures
left unaligned), these alignment discrepancies can be caused by language
contrasts or through the phenomena of explicitation and implicitation in the
translation process. We propose a new approach including new type of resources
for corpus-based language contrast analysis and apply it to study and classify
the contrasts found in our English-German parallel corpus. As unaligned
discourse structures may also result in the loss of discourse information in
the MT training data, we hope to deliver information in support of
discourse-aware machine translation (MT).
