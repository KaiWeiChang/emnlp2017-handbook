Abstract#==#In this paper we present our system in
the DiscoMT 2017 Shared Task on Crosslingual
Pronoun Prediction. Our entry
builds on our last yearâ€™s success, our system
based on deep recurrent neural networks
outperformed all the other systems
with a clear margin. This year we investigate
whether different pre-trained word
embeddings can be used to improve the
neural systems, and whether the recently
published Gated Convolutions outperform
the Gated Recurrent Units used last year.
