Abstract#==#In this paper, we define and assess a reference-based metric to evaluate the
accuracy of pronoun translation (APT). The metric automatically aligns a
candidate and a reference translation using GIZA++ augmented with specific
heuristics, and then counts the number of identical or different pronouns, with
provision for legitimate variations and omitted pronouns.  All counts are then
combined into one score.  The metric is applied to the results of seven systems
(including the baseline) that participated in the DiscoMT 2015 shared task on
pronoun translation from English to French. The APT metric reaches around
0.993-0.999 Pearson correlation with human judges (depending on the parameters
of APT), while other automatic metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, or those specific
to pronouns used at DiscoMT 2015 reach only 0.972-0.986 Pearson correlation.
