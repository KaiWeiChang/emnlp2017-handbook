Abstract#==#Although parallel coreference corpora can
to a high degree support the development
of SMT systems, there are no large-scale
parallel datasets available due to the complexity
of the annotation task and the variability
in annotation schemes. In this
study, we exploit an annotation projection
method to combine the output of two
coreference resolution systems for two
different source languages (English, German)
in order to create an annotated corpus
for a third language (Russian). We
show that our technique is superior to projecting
annotations from a single source
language, and we provide an in-depth
analysis of the projected annotations in order
to assess the perspectives of our approach.
