Abstract#==#This paper presents a new approach for building Language Models using the
Quantum Probability Theory, a Quantum Language Model (QLM). It mainly shows
that relying on this probability calculus it is possible to build stochastic
models able to benefit from quantum correlations due to interference and
entanglement. We extensively tested our approach showing its superior
performances, both in terms of model perplexity and inserting it into an
automatic speech recognition evaluation setting, when compared with
state-of-the-art language modelling techniques.
