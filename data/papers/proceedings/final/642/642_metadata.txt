Abstract#==#We present experiments that show the influence of native language on lexical
choice when producing text in another language -- in this particular case
English. We start from the premise that non-native English speakers will choose
lexical items that are close to words in their native language. This leads us
to an etymology-based representation of documents written by people whose
mother tongue is an Indo-European language. Based on this representation we
grow a language family tree, that matches closely the Indo-European language
tree.
