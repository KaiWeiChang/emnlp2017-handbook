Abstract#==#Mining biomedical text offers an opportunity to automatically discover
important facts and infer associations among them. As new scientific findings
appear across a large collection of biomedical publications, our aim is to tap
into this literature to automate biomedical knowledge extraction and identify
important insights from them. Towards that goal, we develop a system with novel
deep neural networks to extract insights on biomedical literature. Evaluation
shows our system is able to provide insights with competitive accuracy of human
acceptance and its relation extraction component outperforms previous work.
