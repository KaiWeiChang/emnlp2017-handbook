Abstract#==#Identification of intensity ordering among polar (positive or negative) words
which have the same semantics can lead to a fine-grained sentiment analysis.
For
example, 'master', 'seasoned' and 'familiar' point to different intensity
levels, though they all convey the same meaning (semantics), i.e., expertise:
having a good
knowledge of. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised technique that uses
sentiment
bearing word embeddings to produce a continuous ranking among adjectives that
share common semantics. Our system demonstrates a strong Spearmanâ€™s rank
correlation of 0.83 with the gold standard ranking. We show that sentiment
bearing word embeddings facilitate a more accurate intensity ranking system
than other standard word embeddings (word2vec and GloVe). Word2vec is the
state-of-the-art for intensity ordering task.
