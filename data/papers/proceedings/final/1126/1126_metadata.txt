Abstract#==#Word embeddings that can capture semantic and syntactic information from
contexts have been extensively used for various natural language processing
tasks. However, existing methods for learning context-based word embeddings
typically fail to capture sufficient sentiment information. This may result in
words with similar vector representations having an opposite sentiment polarity
(e.g., good and bad), thus degrading sentiment analysis performance. Therefore,
this study proposes a word vector refinement model that can be applied to any
pre-trained word vectors (e.g., Word2vec and GloVe). The refinement model is
based on adjusting the vector representations of words such that they can be
closer to both semantically and sentimentally similar words and further away
from sentimentally dissimilar words. Experimental results show that the
proposed method can improve conventional word embeddings and outperform
previously proposed sentiment embeddings for both binary and fine-grained
classification on Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST).
