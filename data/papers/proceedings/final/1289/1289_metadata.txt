Abstract#==#Automatic construction of large knowledge graphs (KG) by mining web-scale text
datasets has received considerable attention recently. Estimating accuracy of
such automatically constructed KGs is a challenging problem due to their size
and diversity. This important problem has largely been ignored in prior
research â€“ we fill this gap and propose KGEval. KGEval uses coupling
constraints to bind facts and crowdsources those few that can infer large parts
of the graph. We demonstrate that the objective optimized by KGEval is
submodular and NP-hard, allowing guarantees for our approximation algorithm.
Through experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that KGEval best
estimates KG accuracy compared to other baselines, while requiring
significantly lesser number of human evaluations.
