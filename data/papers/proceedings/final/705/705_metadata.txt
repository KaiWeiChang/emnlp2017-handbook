Abstract#==#This article evaluates purported progress over the past years in RST discourse
parsing.
Several studies report a relative error reduction of 24 to 51\% on all metrics
that authors attribute to the introduction of distributed representations of
discourse units.
We replicate the standard evaluation of 9 parsers, 5 of which use distributed
representations, from 8 studies published between 2013 and 2017, using their
predictions on the test set of the RST-DT.
Our main finding is that most recently reported increases in RST discourse
parser performance are an artefact of differences in implementations of the
evaluation procedure.
We evaluate all these parsers with the standard Parseval procedure to provide a
more accurate picture of the actual RST discourse parsers performance in
standard evaluation settings.
Under this more stringent procedure, the gains attributable to distributed
representations represent at most a 16\% relative error reduction on
fully-labelled structures.
