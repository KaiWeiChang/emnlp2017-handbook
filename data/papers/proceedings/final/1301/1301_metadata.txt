Abstract#==#This paper addresses the problem of extracting                                       
     

keyphrases
from
scientific
articles and categorizing them as corresponding to a task, process, or
material. We cast the problem as sequence tagging and introduce 
semi-supervised methods to a neural tagging model, which builds on recent
advances in named entity recognition. Since annotated training data is scarce
in this domain, we introduce a graph-based semi-supervised algorithm together 
with a data selection scheme to leverage unannotated articles. Both inductive
and transductive semi-supervised learning strategies outperform
state-of-the-art information extraction performance on the 2017 SemEval Task 10
ScienceIE task.
