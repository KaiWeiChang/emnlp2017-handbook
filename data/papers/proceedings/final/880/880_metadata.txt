Abstract#==#In this paper, we address the problem of predicting one of three functions for
the English pronoun `it': anaphoric, event reference or pleonastic. This
disambiguation is valuable in the context of machine translation and
coreference resolution. We present experiments using a MAXENT classifier
trained on gold-standard data and self-training experiments of an RNN trained
on silver-standard data, annotated using the MAXENT classifier. Lastly, we
report on an analysis of the strengths of these two models.
