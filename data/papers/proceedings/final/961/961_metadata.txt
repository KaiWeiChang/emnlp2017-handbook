Abstract#==#In order to adopt deep learning for information retrieval, models are needed
that can capture all relevant information required to assess the relevance of a
document to a given
user query. While previous works have successfully captured unigram term
matches, how to fully employ position-dependent information such as proximity
and term dependencies has been insufficiently explored. In this work, we
propose a novel neural IR model named PACRR
aiming at better modeling position-dependent interactions between a query and a
document.
Extensive experiments on six years' TREC Web Track data confirm that the
proposed model yields better results under multiple benchmarks.
