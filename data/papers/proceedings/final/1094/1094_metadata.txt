Abstract#==#The goal of Open Information Extraction (OIE) is to extract surface relations
and their arguments from natural-language text in an unsupervised,
domain-independent manner. In this paper, we propose MinIE, an OIE system that
aims to provide useful, compact extractions with high precision and
recall. MinIE approaches these goals by (1) representing information about
polarity, modality, attribution, and quantities with semantic annotations
instead of in the actual extraction, and (2) identifying and removing parts
that are considered overly specific. We conducted an experimental study with
several real-world datasets and found that MinIE achieves competitive or
higher precision and recall than most prior systems, while at the same time
producing shorter, semantically enriched extractions.
