Abstract#==#Stylistic variations of language, such as formality, carry speakers' intention
beyond literal meaning and should be conveyed adequately in translation. We
propose to use lexical formality models to control the formality level of
machine translation output. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
empirical evaluations, as measured by automatic metrics and human assessments.
