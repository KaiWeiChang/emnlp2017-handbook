Abstract#==#Although many sentiment lexicons in different languages exist, most are not
comprehensive. In a recent sentiment analysis application, we used a large
Chinese sentiment lexicon and found that it missed a large number of sentiment
words in social media. This prompted us to make a new attempt to study
sentiment lexicon expansion. This paper first poses the problem as a PU
learning problem, which is a new formulation. It then proposes a new PU
learning method suitable for our problem using a neural network. The results
are enhanced further with a new dictionary-based technique and a novel polarity
classification technique. Experimental results show that the proposed approach
outperforms baseline methods greatly.
