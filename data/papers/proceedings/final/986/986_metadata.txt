Abstract#==#In this paper, we present a novel approach to infer significance of various
textual  edits to documents. An author may make several edits to a document;
each edit varies in its impact to the content of the document. While some edits
are surface changes and introduce negligible change, other edits may change the
content/tone of the document significantly. In this paper, we perform an
analysis on the human perceptions of edit importance while reviewing documents
from one version to the next. We identify linguistic features that influence
edit importance and model it in a regression based setting. We show that the
predicted importance by our approach is highly correlated with the human
perceived importance, established by a Mechanical Turk study.
