Abstract#==#We present a topic-based analysis of agreement and disagreement in political
manifestos, which relies on a new method for topic detection based on key
concept  clustering. Our approach outperforms both standard techniques like LDA
and a state-of-the-art graph-based method, and provides promising initial
results for this new task in computational social science.
