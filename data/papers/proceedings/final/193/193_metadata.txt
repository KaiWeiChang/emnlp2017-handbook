Abstract#==#The existing word representation methods mostly limit their information source
to word co-occurrence statistics. In this paper, we introduce ngrams into four
representation methods: SGNS, GloVe, PPMI matrix, and its SVD factorization.
Comprehensive experiments are conducted on word analogy and similarity tasks.
The results show that improved word representations are learned from ngram
co-occurrence statistics. We also demonstrate that the trained ngram
representations are useful in many aspects such as finding antonyms and
collocations. Besides, a novel approach of building co-occurrence matrix is
proposed to alleviate the hardware burdens brought by ngrams.
