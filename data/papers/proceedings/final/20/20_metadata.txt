Abstract#==#Discourse coherence is strongly associated with text quality,
making it important to natural language generation and understanding.
Yet existing models of coherence focus on measuring individual aspects of
coherence
(lexical overlap, rhetorical structure, entity centering) in narrow domains.

In this paper, we describe domain-independent neural models
of discourse coherence that are capable of measuring multiple aspects of
coherence 
in existing sentences and can maintain coherence while generating new
sentences.
We study both
discriminative models that learn to distinguish coherent from incoherent
discourse,
and generative models that produce coherent text,
including a novel neural latent-variable Markovian generative model that 
captures the latent discourse dependencies between sentences in a text.

Our work achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple coherence
evaluations,
and marks an initial step in generating coherent texts given discourse
contexts.
