Abstract#==#We develop a novel factored neural model that learns comment embeddings in an
unsupervised way leveraging the structure of distributional context in online
discussion forums. The model links different context with related language
factors in the embedding space, providing a way to interpret the factored
embeddings. Evaluated on a community endorsement prediction task using a large
collection of topic-varying Reddit discussions, the factored embeddings
consistently achieve improvement over other text representations. Qualitative
analysis shows that the model captures community style and topic, as well as
response trigger patterns.
