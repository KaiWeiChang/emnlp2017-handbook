Abstract#==#We present opinion recommendation, a novel task of jointly generating a review
with a rating score that a certain user would give to a certain product which
is unreviewed by the user, given existing reviews to the product by other
users, and the reviews that the user has given to other products. A
characteristic of opinion recommendation is the reliance of multiple data
sources for multi-task joint learning. We use a single neural network to model
users and products, generating customised product representations using a deep
memory network, from which customised ratings and reviews are constructed
jointly. Results show that our opinion recommendation system gives ratings that
are closer to real user ratings on Yelp.com data compared with Yelp's own
ratings. our methods give better results compared to several pipelines
baselines.
