Abstract#==#Multi-document summarization provides users with a short text that summarizes
the information in a set of related documents. This paper introduces
affinity-preserving random walk to the summarization task, which preserves the
affinity relations of sentences by an absorbing random walk model. Meanwhile,
we put forward adjustable affinity-preserving random walk to enforce the
diversity constraint of summarization in the random walk process. The ROUGE
evaluations on DUC 2003 topic-focused summarization task and DUC 2004 generic
summarization task show the good performance of our method, which has the best
ROUGE-2 recall among the graph-based ranking methods.
