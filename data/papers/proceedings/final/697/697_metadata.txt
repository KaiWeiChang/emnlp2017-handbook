Abstract#==#The key to building an evolvable dialogue system in real-world scenarios is to
ensure an affordable on-line dialogue policy learning, which requires the
on-line learning process to be safe, efficient and economical. But in reality,
due to the scarcity of real interaction data, the dialogue system usually grows
slowly. Besides, the poor initial dialogue policy easily leads to bad user
experience and incurs a failure of attracting users to contribute training
data, so that the learning process is unsustainable. To accurately depict this,
 two quantitative metrics are proposed to assess safety and efficiency issues.
For solving the unsustainable learning problem, we proposed a complete
companion teaching framework incorporating the guidance from the human teacher.
Since the human teaching is expensive, we compared various teaching schemes
answering the question how and when to teach, to economically utilize teaching
budget, so that make the online learning process affordable.
