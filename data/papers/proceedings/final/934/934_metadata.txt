Abstract#==#Social media collect and spread on the Web personal opinions, facts, fake news
and all kind of information users may be interested in. Applying argument
mining methods to such heterogeneous data sources is a challenging open
research issue, in particular considering the peculiarities of the language
used to write textual messages on social media. In addition, new issues emerge
when dealing with arguments posted on such platforms, such as the need to make
a distinction between personal opinions and actual facts, and to detect the
source disseminating information about such facts to allow for provenance
verification. In this paper, we apply supervised classification to identify
arguments on Twitter, and we present two new tasks for argument mining, namely
facts recognition and source identification. We study the feasibility of the
approaches proposed to address these tasks on a set of tweets related to the
Grexit and Brexit news topics.
