Abstract#==#Language is increasingly being used to de-fine rich visual recognition problems
with supporting image collections sourced from the web. Structured prediction
models are used  in  these  tasks  to  take  advantage              of correlations 
between  co-occurring  labels and visual input but risk inadvertently encoding
social biases found in web corpora. In this work, we study data and models
associated with multilabel object classification and visual semantic role
labeling. We find that (a) datasets for these tasks contain significant gender
bias and (b) models  trained  on  these  datasets  further  amplify existing
bias.             For example,  the activity cooking is over 33% more likely to 
involve 
females  than  males  in  a  training set, and a trained model further
amplifies the disparity to 68% at test time.  We propose to inject corpus-level
constraints for calibrating existing structured prediction models and design an
algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation for collective inference.  Our method
results in almost no performance loss for the underlying recognition task but
decreases the magnitude of bias amplification by 47.5% and 40.5% for multilabel
classification and visual semantic role labeling, respectivelyã€‚
