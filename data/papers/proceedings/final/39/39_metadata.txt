Abstract#==#A recent study by Plank et al. (2016) found that LSTM-based PoS taggers
considerably improve over the current state-of-the-art when evaluated on the
corpora of the Universal Dependencies project that use a coarse-grained tagset.
We replicate this study using a fresh collection of 27 corpora of 21 languages
that are annotated with fine-grained tagsets of varying size.
Our replication confirms the result in general, and we additionally find that
the advantage of LSTMs is even bigger for larger tagsets.
However, we also find that for the very large tagsets of morphologically rich
languages, hand-crafted morphological lexicons are still necessary to reach
state-of-the-art performance.
