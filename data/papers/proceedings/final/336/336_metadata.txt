Abstract#==#Annotating large numbers of sentences with senses is the heaviest requirement
of current Word Sense Disambiguation. We present Train-O-Matic, a
language-independent method for generating millions of sense-annotated training
instances for virtually all meanings of words in a language's vocabulary. The
approach is fully automatic: no human intervention is required and the only
type of human knowledge used is a WordNet-like resource. Train-O-Matic achieves
consistently state-of-the-art performance across gold standard datasets and
languages, while at the same time removing the burden of manual annotation. All
the training data is available for research purposes at http://trainomatic.org.
