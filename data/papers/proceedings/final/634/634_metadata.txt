Abstract#==#In domain-specific NER, due to insufficient labeled training data, deep models
usually fail to behave normally. In this paper, we proposed a novel Neural
Inductive TEaching framework (NITE) to transfer knowledge from existing
domain-specific NER models into an arbitrary deep neural network in a
teacher-student training manner. NITE is a general framework that builds upon
transfer learning and multiple instance learning, which collaboratively not
only transfers knowledge to a deep student network but also reduces the noise
from teachers. NITE can help deep learning methods to effectively utilize
existing resources (i.e., models, labeled and unlabeled data) in a small
domain. The experiment resulted on Disease NER proved that without using any
labeled data, NITE can significantly boost the performance of a
CNN-bidirectional LSTM-CRF NER neural network nearly over 30% in terms of
F1-score.
