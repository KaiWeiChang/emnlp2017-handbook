Abstract#==#We present a transition-based AMR parser that directly generates AMR parses
from plain text. 
We use Stack-LSTMs to represent our parser state and make decisions greedily.
In our experiments, we show that our parser achieves very competitive scores on
English using only AMR training data. Adding additional information, such as
POS tags and dependency trees, improves the results further.
