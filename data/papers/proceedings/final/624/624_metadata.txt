Abstract#==#Determining semantic textual similarity is a core research subject in natural
language processing.
Since vector-based models for sentence representation often use shallow
information, capturing accurate semantics is difficult. By contrast, logical
semantic representations capture deeper levels of sentence semantics, but their
symbolic nature does not offer graded notions of textual similarity.
We propose a method for determining semantic textual similarity by combining
shallow features with features extracted from natural deduction proofs of
bidirectional entailment relations between sentence pairs. For the natural
deduction proofs, we use ccg2lambda, a higher-order automatic inference system,
which converts Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) derivation trees into
semantic representations and conducts natural deduction proofs. Experiments
show that our system was able to outperform other logic-based systems and that
features derived from the proofs are effective for learning textual similarity.
