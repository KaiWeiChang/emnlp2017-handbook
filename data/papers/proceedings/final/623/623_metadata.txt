Abstract#==#User generated content about products and services in the form of reviews are
often diverse and even contradictory. This makes it difficult for users to know
if an opinion in a review is prevalent or biased.
We study the problem of searching for supporting opinions in the context of
reviews. We propose a framework called SURF, that first identifies opinions
expressed in a review, and then finds similar opinions from other reviews. We
design a novel probabilistic graphical model that captures opinions as a
combination of aspect, topic and sentiment dimensions, takes into account the
preferences of individual authors, as well as the quality of the  entity under
review, and encodes the flow of thoughts in a review by constraining the aspect
distribution dynamically among successive review segments. We derive a
similarity measure that  considers both lexical and semantic similarity to find
supporting opinions. Experiments on TripAdvisor hotel reviews and Yelp
restaurant reviews  show that  our model outperforms  existing methods for
modeling opinions, and the proposed framework is effective in finding
supporting opinions.
