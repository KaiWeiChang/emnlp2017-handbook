Abstract#==#In this paper, we investigate large-scale zero-shot activity recognition by
modeling the visual and linguistic attributes of action verbs. For example, the
verb ``salute'' has several properties, such as being a light movement, a
social act, and short in duration. We use these attributes as the internal
mapping between visual and textual representations to reason about a previously
unseen action. In contrast to much prior work that assumes access to gold
standard attributes for zero-shot classes and focuses primarily on object
attributes, our model uniquely learns to infer action attributes from
dictionary definitions and distributed word representations. Experimental
results confirm that action attributes inferred from language can provide a
predictive signal for zero-shot prediction of previously unseen activities.
