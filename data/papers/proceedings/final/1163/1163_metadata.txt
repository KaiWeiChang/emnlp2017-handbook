Abstract#==#This paper presents a corpus and experiments to determine dimensions of
interpersonal relationships. We define a set of dimensions heavily inspired by
work in social science. We create a corpus by retrieving pairs of people, and
then annotating dimensions for their relationships. A corpus analysis shows
that dimensions can be annotated reliably. Experimental results show that given
a pair of people, values to dimensions can be assigned automatically.
