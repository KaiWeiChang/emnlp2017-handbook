Abstract#==#For accurate entity linking, we need to capture various information aspects of
an entity, such as its description in a KB, contexts in which it is mentioned,
and structured knowledge. Additionally, a linking system should work on texts
from different domains without requiring domain-specific training data or
hand-engineered features.

In this work we present a neural, modular entity linking system that learns a
unified dense representation for each entity using multiple sources of
information, such as its description, contexts around its mentions, and its
fine-grained types. We show that the resulting entity linking system is
effective at combining these sources, and performs competitively, sometimes
out-performing current state-of-the-art systems across datasets, without
requiring any domain-specific training data or hand-engineered features. We
also show that our model can effectively “embed” entities that are new to
the KB, and is able to link its mentions accurately.
