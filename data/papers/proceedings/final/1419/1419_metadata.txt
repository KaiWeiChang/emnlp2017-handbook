Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose to use a set of simple, uniform in architecture
LSTM-based models to recover different kinds of temporal relations from text.
Using the shortest dependency path between entities as input, the same
architecture is used to extract intra-sentence, cross-sentence, and document
creation time relations. A ``double-checking'' technique reverses entity pairs
in classification, boosting the recall of positive cases and reducing
misclassifications between opposite classes. An efficient pruning algorithm
resolves conflicts globally. Evaluated on QA-TempEval (SemEval2015 Task 5), our
proposed technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. We
also conduct intrinsic evaluation and post state-of-the-art results on
Timebank-Dense.
