Abstract#==#This paper presents a novel template-based method to solve math word problems.
This method learns the mappings between math concept phrases in math word
problems and their math expressions from training data. For each equation
template, we automatically construct a rich template sketch by aggregating
information from various problems with the same template. Our approach is
implemented in a two-stage system. It first retrieves a few relevant equation
system templates and aligns numbers in math word problems to those templates
for candidate equation generation. It then does a fine-grained inference to
obtain the final answer. Experiment results show that our method achieves an
accuracy of 28.4% on the linear Dolphin18K benchmark, which is 10% (54%
relative) higher than previous state-of-the-art systems while achieving an
accuracy
increase of 12% (59% relative) on the TS6 benchmark subset.
