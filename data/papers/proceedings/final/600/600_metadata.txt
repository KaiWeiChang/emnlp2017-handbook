Abstract#==#We introduce a novel mixed characterword architecture to improve Chinese
sentence representations, by utilizing rich semantic information of word
internal structures. Our architecture uses two key strategies. The first is a
mask gate on characters, learning the relation among characters in a word. The
second is a maxpooling operation on words, adaptively finding the optimal
mixture of the atomic and compositional word representations. Finally, the
proposed architecture is applied to various sentence composition models, which
achieves substantial performance gains over baseline models on sentence
similarity task.
