Abstract#==#Reasoning with commonsense knowledge is critical for natural language
understanding. Traditional methods for commonsense machine comprehension mostly
only focus on one specific kind of knowledge, neglecting the fact that
commonsense reasoning requires simultaneously considering different kinds of
commonsense knowledge. In this paper, we propose a multi-knowledge reasoning
method, which can exploit heterogeneous knowledge for commonsense machine
comprehension. Specifically, we first mine different kinds of knowledge
(including event narrative knowledge, entity semantic knowledge and sentiment
coherent knowledge) and encode them as inference rules with costs. Then we
propose a multi-knowledge reasoning model, which selects inference rules for a
specific reasoning context using attention mechanism, and reasons by
summarizing all valid inference rules. Experiments on RocStories show that our
method outperforms traditional models significantly.
