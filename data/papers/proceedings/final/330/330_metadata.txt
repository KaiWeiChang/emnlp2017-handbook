Abstract#==#In this paper, we present a novel document similarity measure based on the
definition of a graph kernel between pairs of documents. The proposed measure
takes into account both the terms contained in the documents and the
relationships between them. By representing each document as a graph-of-words,
we are able to model these relationships and then determine how similar two
documents are by using a modified shortest-path graph kernel. We evaluate our
approach on two tasks and compare it against several baseline approaches using
various performance metrics such as DET curves and macro-average F1-score.
Experimental results on a range of datasets showed that our proposed approach
outperforms traditional techniques and is capable of measuring more accurately
the similarity between two documents.
