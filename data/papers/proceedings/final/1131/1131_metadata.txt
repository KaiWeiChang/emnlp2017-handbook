Abstract#==#We present a system for identifying cognate sets across dictionaries of related
languages. The likelihood of a cognate relationship is calculated on the basis
of a rich set of features that capture both phonetic and semantic similarity,
as well as the presence of regular sound correspondences. The similarity scores
are used to cluster words from different languages that may originate from a
common proto-word. When tested on the Algonquian language family, our system
detects 63% of cognate sets while maintaining cluster purity of 70%.
