Abstract#==#In a controlled experiment of sequence-to-sequence approaches for the task of
sentence correction, we find that character-based models are generally more
effective than word-based models and models that encode subword information via
convolutions, and that modeling the output data as a series of diffs improves
effectiveness over standard approaches. Our strongest sequence-to-sequence
model improves over our strongest phrase-based statistical machine translation
model, with access to the same data, by 6 M2 (0.5 GLEU) points. Additionally,
in the data environment of the standard CoNLL-2014 setup, we demonstrate that
modeling (and tuning against) diffs yields similar or better M2 scores with
simpler models and/or significantly less data than previous
sequence-to-sequence approaches.
