Abstract#==#Instance weighting has been widely applied to phrase-based machine translation
domain adaptation. However, it is challenging to be applied to Neural Machine
Translation (NMT) directly, because NMT is not a linear model. In this paper,
two instance weighting technologies, i.e., sentence weighting and domain
weighting with a dynamic weight learning strategy, are proposed for NMT domain
adaptation. Empirical results on the IWSLT English-German/French tasks show
that the proposed methods can substantially improve NMT performance by up to
2.7-6.7 BLEU points, outperforming the existing baselines by up to 1.6-3.6 BLEU
points.
