Abstract#==#Traditional supervised learning makes the closed-world assumption that the
classes appeared in the test data must have appeared in training. This also
applies to text learning or text classification. As learning is used
increasingly in dynamic open environments where some new/test documents may not
belong to any of the training classes, identifying these novel documents during
classification presents an important problem. This problem is called open-world
classification or open classification. This paper proposes a novel deep
learning based approach. It outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques
dramatically.
