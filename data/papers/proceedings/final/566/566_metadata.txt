Abstract#==#Word Sense Disambiguation models exist in many flavors. Even though supervised
ones tend to perform best in terms of accuracy, they often lose ground to more
flexible knowledge-based solutions, which do not require training by a word
expert for every disambiguation target. To bridge this gap we adopt a different
perspective and rely on sequence learning to frame the disambiguation problem:
we propose and study in depth a series of end-to-end neural architectures
directly tailored to the task, from bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory to
encoder-decoder models. Our extensive evaluation over standard benchmarks and
in multiple languages shows that sequence learning enables more versatile
all-words models that consistently lead to state-of-the-art results, even
against word experts with engineered features.
