Abstract#==#One of the most pressing issues in discontinuous constituency transition-based
parsing is that the relevant information for parsing decisions could be located
in any part of the stack or the buffer. 
In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem by replacing the
structured perceptron model with a recursive neural model that computes a
global representation of the configuration, therefore allowing even the most
remote parts of the configuration to influence the parsing decisions. We also
provide a detailed analysis of how this representation should be built out of
sub-representations of its core elements (words, trees and stack).
 Additionally, we investigate how different types of swap oracles influence the
results.  Our model is the first neural discontinuous constituency parser, and
it outperforms all the previously published models on three out of four
datasets while on the fourth it obtains second place by a tiny difference.
