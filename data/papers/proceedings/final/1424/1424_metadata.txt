Abstract#==#One central mystery of neural NLP is what neural models "know" about their
subject matter. When a neural machine translation system learns to translate
from one language to another, does it learn the syntax or semantics of the
languages? Can this knowledge be extracted from the system to fill holes in
human scientific knowledge? Existing typological databases contain relatively
full feature specifications for only a few hundred languages. Exploiting the
existence of parallel texts in more than a thousand languages, we build a
massive many-to-one NMT system from 1017 languages into English, and use this
to predict information missing from typological databases. Experiments show
that the proposed method is able to infer not only syntactic, but also
phonological and phonetic inventory features, and improves over a baseline that
has access to information about the languages geographic and phylogenetic
neighbors.
