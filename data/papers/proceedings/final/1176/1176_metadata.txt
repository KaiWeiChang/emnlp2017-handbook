Abstract#==#Building a dialogue agent to fulfill complex tasks, such as travel planning, is
challenging because the agent has to learn to collectively complete multiple
subtasks. For example, the agent needs to reserve a hotel and book a flight so
that there leaves enough time for commute between arrival and hotel check-in.
This paper addresses this challenge by formulating the task in the mathematical
framework of options over Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), and proposing a
hierarchical deep reinforcement learning approach to learning a dialogue
manager that operates at different temporal scales. The dialogue manager
consists of: (1) a top-level dialogue policy that selects among subtasks or
options, (2) a low-level dialogue policy that selects primitive actions to
complete the subtask given by the top-level policy, and (3) a global state
tracker that helps ensure all cross-subtask constraints be satisfied.
Experiments on a travel planning task with simulated and real users show that
our approach leads to significant improvements over three baselines, two based
on handcrafted rules and the other based on flat deep reinforcement learning.
