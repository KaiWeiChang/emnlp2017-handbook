Abstract#==#We apply adversarial training to open-domain dialogue generation,
training a system to produce sequences that are
 indistinguishable from human-generated dialogue utterances. 
We cast the task as a reinforcement learning problem where we jointly train two
systems: a generative model to produce response sequences, and a
discriminator---analagous to the human evaluator in the Turing test--- to
distinguish between 
 the 
 human-generated dialogues and the machine-generated ones. 
In this generative adversarial network approach,
the outputs from the discriminator are 
used to encourage the system towards more human-like dialogue.

Further, we investigate models
for adversarial  evaluation that 
uses success in fooling an adversary as a dialogue evaluation metric,
while avoiding a number of potential pitfalls.

Experimental results on several
metrics, including adversarial evaluation, demonstrate
that the adversarially-trained system generates higher-quality responses
than previous baselines
