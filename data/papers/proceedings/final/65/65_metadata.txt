Abstract#==#In this paper we show that reporting a single performance score is insufficient
to compare non-deterministic approaches. We demonstrate for common sequence
tagging tasks that the seed value for the random number generator can result in
statistically significant p < 10^-4 differences for state-of-the-art systems.
For two recent systems for NER, we observe an absolute difference of one
percentage point F_1-score depending on the selected seed value, making these
systems perceived either as state-of-the-art or mediocre. Instead of publishing
and reporting single performance scores, we propose to compare score
distributions based on multiple executions. 
Based on the evaluation of 50.000 LSTM-networks for five sequence tagging
tasks, we present network architectures that produce both superior performance
as well as are more stable with respect to the remaining hyperparameters.
