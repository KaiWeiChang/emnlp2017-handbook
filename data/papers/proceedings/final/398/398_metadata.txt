Abstract#==#In this paper, we introduce a hybrid search for attention-based neural machine
translation (NMT). A target phrase learned with statistical MT models extends a
hypothesis in the NMT beam search when the attention of the NMT model focuses
on the source words translated by this phrase. Phrases added in this way are
scored with the NMT model, but also with SMT features including phrase-level
translation probabilities and a target language model. Experimental results on
German-to-English news domain and English-to-Russian e-commerce domain 
translation tasks show that using phrase-based models in NMT search improves MT
quality by up to 2.3\% BLEU absolute as compared to a strong NMT baseline.
