Abstract#==#We propose simple and flexible training and decoding methods for influencing
output style and topic in neural encoder-decoder based language generation.
This capability is desirable in a variety of applications, including
conversational systems, where successful agents need to produce language in a
specific style and generate responses steered by a human puppeteer or external
knowledge. We decompose the neural generation process into empirically easier
sub-problems: a faithfulness model and a decoding method based on
selective-sampling. We also describe training and sampling algorithms that bias
the generation process with a specific language style restriction, or a topic
restriction. Human evaluation results show that our proposed methods are able
to to restrict style and topic without degrading output quality in
conversational tasks.
