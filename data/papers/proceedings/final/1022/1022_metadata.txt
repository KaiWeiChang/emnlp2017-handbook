Abstract#==#Social media users often make explicit predictions about upcoming events. Such
statements vary in the degree of certainty the author expresses toward the
outcome: "Leonardo DiCaprio will win Best Actor" vs. "Leonardo DiCaprio may
win" or "No way Leonardo wins!". Can popular beliefs on social media predict
who will win? To answer this question, we build a corpus of tweets annotated
for veridicality on which we train a log-linear classifier that detects
positive veridicality with high precision. We then forecast uncertain outcomes
using the wisdom of crowds, by aggregating users' explicit predictions. Our
method for forecasting winners is fully automated, relying only on a set of
contenders as input. It requires no training data of past outcomes and
outperforms sentiment and tweet volume baselines on a broad range of contest
prediction tasks. We further demonstrate how our approach can be used to
measure the reliability of individual accounts' predictions and retrospectively
identify surprise outcomes.
