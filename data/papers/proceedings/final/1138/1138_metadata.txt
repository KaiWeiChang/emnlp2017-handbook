Abstract#==#Automatic story comprehension is a fundamental challenge in Natural Language
Understanding, and can enable computers to learn about social norms, human
behavior and commonsense. In this paper, we present a story comprehension model
that explores three distinct semantic aspects: (i) the sequence of events
described in the story, (ii) its emotional trajectory, and (iii) its plot
consistency. We judge the model's understanding of real-world stories by
inquiring if, like humans, it can develop an expectation of what will happen
next in a given story. Specifically, we use it to predict the correct ending of
a given short story from possible alternatives. The model uses a hidden
variable to weigh the semantic aspects in the context of the story. Our
experiments demonstrate the potential of our approach to characterize these
semantic aspects, and the strength of the hidden variable based approach. The
model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches and achieves best results on
a publicly available dataset.
