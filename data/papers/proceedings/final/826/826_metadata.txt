Abstract#==#Distant-supervised relation extraction inevitably suffers from wrong labeling
problems because it heuristically labels relational facts with knowledge bases.
Previous sentence level denoise models donâ€™t achieve satisfying performances
because they use hard labels which are determined by distant supervision and
immutable during training. To this end, we introduce an entity-pair level
denoise method which exploits semantic information from correctly labeled
entity pairs to correct wrong labels dynamically during training. We propose a
joint score
function which combines the relational scores based on the entity-pair
representation and the confidence of the hard label to obtain a new label,
namely a soft label, for certain entity pair. During training, soft labels
instead of hard labels serve as gold labels. Experiments on the benchmark
dataset show that our method dramatically reduces noisy instances and
outperforms other state-of-the-art systems.
