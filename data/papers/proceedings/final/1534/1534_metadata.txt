Abstract#==#We introduce a method for measuring the correspondence between low-level speech
features and human perception, using a cognitive model of speech perception
implemented directly on speech recordings.  We evaluate two speaker
normalization techniques using this method and find that in both cases, speech
features that are normalized across speakers predict human data better than
unnormalized speech features, consistent with previous research.  Results
further reveal differences across normalization methods in how well each
predicts human data.  This work provides a new framework for evaluating
low-level representations of speech on their match to human perception, and
lays the groundwork for creating more ecologically valid models of speech
perception.
