Abstract#==#Machine translation is a natural candidate
problem for reinforcement learning from
human feedback: users provide quick,
dirty ratings on candidate translations to
guide a system to improve. Yet, current
neural machine translation training focuses
on expensive human-generated reference
translations. We describe a reinforcement
learning algorithm that improves
neural machine translation systems
from simulated human feedback.
Our algorithm combines the advantage
actor-critic algorithm (Mnih et al., 2016)
with the attention-based neural encoder-decoder
architecture (Luong et al., 2015).
This algorithm (a) is well-designed for
problems with a large action space and
delayed rewards, (b) effectively optimizes
traditional corpus-level machine translation
metrics, and (c) is robust to skewed,
high-variance, granular feedback modeled
after actual human behaviors.
