Abstract#==#Cross-lingual natural language processing hinges on the premise that there
exists invariance across languages. At the word level, researchers have
identified such invariance in the word embedding semantic spaces of different
languages. However, in order to connect the separate spaces, cross-lingual
supervision encoded in parallel data is typically required. In this paper, we
attempt to establish the cross-lingual connection without relying on any
cross-lingual supervision. By viewing word embedding spaces as distributions,
we propose to minimize their earth mover's distance, a measure of divergence
between distributions. We demonstrate the success on the unsupervised bilingual
lexicon induction task. In addition, we reveal an interesting finding that the
earth mover's distance shows potential as a measure of language difference.
