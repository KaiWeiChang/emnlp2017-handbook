Abstract#==#One of the main obstacles for many Digital Humanities projects is the low data
availability. Texts have to be digitized in an expensive and time consuming
process whereas Optical Character Recognition (OCR) post-correction is one of
the time-critical factors. At the example of OCR post-correction, we show the
adaptation of a generic system to solve a specific problem with little data.
The system accounts for a diversity of errors encountered in OCRed texts coming
from different time periods in the domain of literature. We show that the
combination of different approaches, such as e.g. Statistical Machine
Translation and spell checking, with the help of a ranking mechanism
tremendously improves over single-handed approaches. Since we consider the
accessibility of the resulting tool as
a crucial part of Digital Humanities collaborations, we describe the workflow
we suggest for efficient text recognition and subsequent automatic and manual
post-correction
