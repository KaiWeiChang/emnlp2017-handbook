Abstract#==#We study the problem of automatically identifying humorous text from a new kind
of text data, i.e., online reviews. We propose a generative language model,
based on the theory of incongruity, to model humorous text, which allows us to
leverage background text sources, such as Wikipedia entry descriptions, and
enables construction of multiple features for identifying humorous reviews.
Evaluation of these features using supervised learning for classifying reviews
into humorous and non-humorous reviews shows that the features constructed
based on the proposed generative model are much more effective than the major
features proposed in the existing literature, allowing us to achieve almost
86\% accuracy. These humorous review predictions can also supply good
indicators for identifying helpful reviews.
