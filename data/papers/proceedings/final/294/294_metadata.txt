Abstract#==#This paper presents how to generate questions from given passages using neural
networks, where large scale QA pairs are automatically crawled and processed
from Community-QA website, and used as training data. The contribution of the
paper is 2-fold: First, two types of question generation approaches are
proposed, one is a retrieval-based method using convolution neural network
(CNN), the other is a generation-based method using recurrent
neural network (RNN); Second, we show how to leverage the generated questions
to improve existing question answering systems. We evaluate our question
generation method for the answer sentence selection task on three benchmark
datasets, including SQuAD, MS MARCO, and WikiQA. Experimental results show
that, by using generated questions as an extra signal, significant QA
improvement can be achieved.
