Abstract#==#The diagnosis of serious mental health conditions such as schizophrenia is
based on the judgment of clinicians whose training takes several years, and
cannot be easily formalized into objective measures. However, previous research
suggests there are disturbances in aspects of the language use of patients with
schizophrenia.                                      

Using metaphor-identification and sentiment-analysis
algorithms to automatically generate features, we create a classifier,               
     

that,
with high
accuracy, can predict which patients will develop (or currently suffer from)
schizophrenia.                                      

To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate
the utility of automated metaphor identification algorithms for detection or
prediction of disease.
