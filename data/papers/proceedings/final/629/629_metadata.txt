Abstract#==#Automatically understanding the plot of novels is important both for informing
literary scholarship and applications such as summarization or recommendation.
Various models have addressed this task, but their evaluation has remained
largely intrinsic and qualitative. Here, we propose a principled and scalable
framework leveraging expert-provided semantic tags (e.g., mystery, pirates) to
evaluate plot representations in an extrinsic fashion, assessing their ability
to produce locally coherent groupings of novels (micro-clusters) in model
space. We present a deep recurrent autoencoder model that learns richly
structured multi-view plot representations, and show that they i) yield better
micro-clusters than less structured representations; and ii) are interpretable,
and thus useful for further literary analysis or labeling of the emerging
micro-clusters.
