Abstract#==#In neural text generation such as neural
machine translation, summarization, and
image captioning, beam search is widely
used to improve the output text quality.
However, in the neural generation set-
ting, hypotheses can finish in different
steps, which makes it difficult to decide
when to end beam search to ensure op-
timality. We propose a provably optimal
beam search algorithm that will always re-
turn the optimal-score complete hypothe-
sis (modulo beam size), and finish as soon
as the optimality is established. To counter
neural generationâ€™s tendency for shorter
hypotheses, we also introduce a bounded
length reward mechanism which allows a
modified version of our beam search al-
gorithm to remain optimal. Experiments
on neural machine translation demonstrate
that our principled beam search algorithm
leads to improvement in BLEU score over
previously proposed alternatives.
