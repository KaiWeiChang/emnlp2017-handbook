Abstract#==#NLP tasks are often limited by scarcity of manually annotated data. In social
media sentiment analysis and related tasks, researchers have therefore used
binarized emoticons and specific hashtags as forms of distant supervision. Our
paper shows that by extending the distant supervision to a more diverse set of
noisy labels, the models can learn richer representations. Through emoji
prediction on a dataset of 1246 million tweets containing one of 64 common
emojis we obtain state-of-the-art performance on 8 benchmark datasets
within emotion, sentiment and sarcasm detection using a single pretrained
model. Our analyses confirm that the diversity of our emotional labels yield a
performance improvement over previous distant supervision approaches.
