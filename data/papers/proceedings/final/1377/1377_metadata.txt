Abstract#==#We present supertagging-based models for Tree Adjoining Grammar parsing that
use neural network architectures and dense vector representation of supertags
(elementary trees) to achieve state-of-the-art performance in unlabeled and
labeled attachment scores. The shift-reduce parsing model eschews lexical
information entirely, and uses only the 1-best supertags to parse a sentence,
providing further support for the claim that supertagging is "almost parsing."
We demonstrate that the embedding vector representations the parser induces for
supertags possess linguistically interpretable structure, supporting analogies
between grammatical structures like those familiar from recent work in
distributional semantics. This dense representation of supertags overcomes the
drawbacks for statistical models of TAG as compared to CCG parsing, raising the
possibility that TAG is a viable alternative for NLP tasks that require the
assignment of richer structural descriptions to sentences.
