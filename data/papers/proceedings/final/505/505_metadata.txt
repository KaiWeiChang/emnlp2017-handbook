Abstract#==#A number of recent works have proposed techniques for end-to-end learning of
communication protocols among cooperative multi-agent populations, and have
simultaneously found the emergence of grounded human-interpretable language in
the protocols developed by the agents, learned without any human supervision!

In this paper, using a Task & Talk reference game between two agents as a
testbed,  we present a sequence of `negative' results culminating in a
`positive' one -- showing that while most agent-invented languages are
effective (i.e. achieve near-perfect task rewards), they are decidedly not
interpretable or compositional. In essence, we find that natural language does
not emerge `naturally',despite the semblance of ease of
natural-language-emergence that one may gather from recent literature. We
discuss how it is possible to coax the invented languages to become more and
more human-like and compositional by increasing restrictions on how two agents
may communicate.
