Abstract#==#RLIE-DQN is a recently proposed Reinforcement Learning-based Information
Extraction (IE) technique which is able to incorporate external evidence during
the extraction process. RLIE-DQN trains a single agent sequentially, training
on one instance at a time. This results in significant training slowdown which
is undesirable. We leverage recent advances in parallel RL training using
asynchronous methods and propose RLIE-A3C. RLIE-A3C trains multiple agents in
parallel and is able to achieve upto 6x training speedup over RLIE-DQN, while
suffering no loss in average accuracy.
