Abstract#==#Even for common NLP tasks, sufficient supervision is not available in many
languages -- morphological tagging is no exception. In the work presented here,
we explore a transfer learning scheme, whereby we train character-level
recurrent neural taggers to predict morphological taggings for high-resource
languages and low-resource languages together. Learning joint character
representations among multiple related languages successfully enables knowledge
transfer from the high-resource languages to the low-resource ones.
