Abstract#==#We propose a deep learning architecture to capture argumentative relations of
attack and support from one piece of text to another, of the kind that
naturally occur in a debate. The architecture uses two (unidirectional or
bidirectional) Long Short-Term Memory networks and (trained or non-trained)
word embeddings, and allows to considerably improve upon existing techniques
that use syntactic features and supervised classifiers for the same form of
(relation-based) argument mining.
