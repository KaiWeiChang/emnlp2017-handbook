Abstract#==#The rapid increase of the multimedia data over the Internet necessitates
multi-modal summarization from collections of text, image, audio and video.  
In this work, we propose an extractive Multi-modal Summarization (MMS) method
which can automatically generate a textual summary given a set of documents,
images, audios and videos related to a specific topic. The key idea is to
bridge the semantic gaps between multi-modal contents. For audio information,
we design an approach to selectively use its transcription. For vision
information, we learn joint representations of texts and images using a neural
network. Finally, all the multi-modal aspects are considered to generate the
textural summary by maximizing the salience, non-redundancy, readability and
coverage through budgeted optimization of submodular functions.  We further
introduce an MMS corpus in English and Chinese. The experimental results on
this dataset demonstrate that our
method outperforms other competitive baseline methods.
