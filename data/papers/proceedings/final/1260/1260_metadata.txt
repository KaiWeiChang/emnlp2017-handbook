Abstract#==#We interpret the predictions of any black-box structured input-structured
output model around a specific input-output pair. Our method returns an
"explanation" consisting of groups of input-output tokens that are causally
related.  These dependencies are inferred by querying the model with perturbed
inputs, generating a graph over tokens from the responses, and solving a
partitioning problem to select the most relevant components. We focus the
general approach on sequence-to-sequence problems, adopting a variational
autoencoder to yield meaningful input perturbations. We test our method across
several NLP sequence generation tasks.
