Abstract#==#In this paper, we model the problem of disfluency detection using a
transition-based framework, which incrementally constructs and labels the
disfluency chunk of input sentences using a new transition system without
syntax information. Compared with sequence labeling methods, it can capture
non-local chunk-level features; compared with joint parsing and disfluency
detection methods, it is free for noise in syntax. Experiments show that our
model achieves state-of-the-art f-score of 87.5\% on the commonly used English
Switchboard test set, and a set of  in-house annotated Chinese data.
