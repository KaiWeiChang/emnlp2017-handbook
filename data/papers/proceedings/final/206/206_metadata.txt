Abstract#==#A first step in the task of automatically generating questions for testing
reading comprehension is to identify \emph{question-worthy} sentences, i.e.
sentences in a text passage that humans find it worthwhile to ask questions
about. We propose a hierarchical neural sentence-level sequence tagging model
for this task, which existing approaches to question generation have ignored.
The approach is fully data-driven — with no sophisticated NLP pipelines or
any hand-crafted rules/features — and compares favorably to a number of
baselines when evaluated on the SQuAD data set. When incorporated into an
existing neural question generation system, the resulting end-to-end system
achieves state-of-the-art performance for paragraph-level question generation
for reading comprehension.
