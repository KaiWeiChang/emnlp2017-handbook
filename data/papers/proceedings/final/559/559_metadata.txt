Abstract#==#The number of word embedding models is growing every year. Most of them are
based on the co-occurrence information of words and their contexts. However, it
is still an open question what is the best definition of context. We provide a
systematical investigation of 4 different syntactic context types and context
representations for learning word embeddings. Comprehensive experiments are
conducted to evaluate their effectiveness on 6 extrinsic and intrinsic tasks.
We hope that this paper, along with the published code, would be helpful for
choosing the best context type and representation for a given task.
