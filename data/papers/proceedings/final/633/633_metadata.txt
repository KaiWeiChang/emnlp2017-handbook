Abstract#==#Users suffering from mental health conditions often turn to online resources
for support, including specialized online support communities or general
communities such as Twitter and Reddit. In this work, we present a framework
for supporting and studying users in both types of communities. We propose
methods for identifying posts in support communities that may indicate a risk
of self-harm, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong previously
proposed methods for identifying such posts. Self-harm is closely related to
depression, which makes identifying depressed users on general forums a crucial
related task. We introduce a large-scale general forum dataset consisting of
users with self-reported depression diagnoses matched with control users. We
show how our method can be applied to effectively identify depressed users from
their use of language alone. We demonstrate that our method outperforms strong
baselines on this general forum dataset.
