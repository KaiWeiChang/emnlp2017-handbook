Abstract#==#We address the problem of end-to-end visual storytelling. 
Given a photo album, our model first selects the most representative (summary)
photos, and then composes a natural language story for the album.
For this task, we make use of the Visual Storytelling dataset and a model
composed of three hierarchically-attentive Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs) to:
encode the album photos, select representative (summary) photos, and  compose
the story. Automatic and human evaluations show our model achieves better
performance on
selection, generation, and retrieval than baselines.
