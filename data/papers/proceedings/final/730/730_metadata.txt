Abstract#==#Comprehending lyrics, as found in songs and poems, can pose a challenge to
human and machine readers alike.  This motivates the need for systems that can
understand the ambiguity and jargon found in such creative texts, and provide
commentary to aid readers in reaching the correct interpretation.
We introduce the task of automated lyric annotation (ALA).  Like text
simplification, a goal of ALA is to rephrase the original text in a more easily
understandable manner. However, in ALA the system must often include additional
information to clarify niche terminology and abstract concepts. To stimulate
research on this task, we release a large collection of crowdsourced
annotations for song lyrics. We analyze the performance of translation and
retrieval models on this task, measuring performance with both automated and
human evaluation. We find that each model captures a unique type of information
important to the task.
