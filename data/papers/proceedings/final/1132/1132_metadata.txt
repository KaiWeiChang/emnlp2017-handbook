Abstract#==#The need for automatic document summarization that can be used for practical
applications is increasing rapidly. In this paper, we propose a general
framework for summarization that extracts sentences from a document using
externally related information. Our work is aimed at single document
summarization using small amounts of reference summaries. In particular, we
address document summarization in the framework of multi-task learning using
curriculum learning for sentence extraction and document classification. The
proposed framework enables us to obtain better feature representations to
extract sentences from documents. We evaluate our proposed summarization method
on two datasets: financial report and news corpus. Experimental results
demonstrate that our summarizers achieve performance that is comparable to
state-of-the-art systems.
