Abstract#==#In this paper, we demonstrate how the state-of-the-art machine learning and
text mining techniques can be used to build effective social media-based
substance use detection systems.  Since a substance use ground truth is
difficult to obtain on a large scale, to maximize system performance, we
explore different unsupervised feature learning methods to take advantage of a
large amount of unsupervised social media data. We also demonstrate the benefit
of using multi-view unsupervised feature learning to combine heterogeneous user
information such as Facebook "likes" and  "status updates"  to enhance system
performance.  Based on our evaluation, our best models achieved 86% AUC for
predicting tobacco use,  81% for alcohol use and 84% for illicit drug use, all
of which significantly outperformed existing methods. Our investigation has
also uncovered interesting relations between a user's social media behavior
(e.g., word usage) and substance use.
