Abstract#==#In this paper, we address the problem of generating English tag questions (TQs)
(e.g. it is, isn’t it?) in Machine Translation (MT). We propose a
post-edition solution, formulating the problem as a multi-class classification
task. We present (i) the automatic annotation of English TQs in a parallel
corpus of subtitles and (ii) an approach using a series of classifiers to
predict TQ forms, which we use to post-edit state-of-the-art MT outputs. Our
method provides significant improvements in English TQ translation when
translating from Czech, French and German, in turn improving the fluidity,
naturalness, grammatical correctness and pragmatic coherence of MT output.
