Abstract#==#Selectional preferences have long been claimed to be essential for coreference
resolution. However, they are modeled only implicitly by current coreference
resolvers. We propose a dependency-based embedding model of selectional
preferences which allows fine-grained compatibility judgments with high
coverage. Incorporating our model improves performance, matching
state-of-the-art results of a more complex system. However, it comes with a
cost that makes it debatable how worthwhile are such improvements.
