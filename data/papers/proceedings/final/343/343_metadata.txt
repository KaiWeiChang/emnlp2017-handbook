Abstract#==#We introduce globally normalized convolutional neural networks for joint entity
classification and relation extraction. In particular, we propose a way to
utilize a linear-chain conditional random field output layer for predicting
entity types and relations between entities at the same time. Our experiments
show that global normalization outperforms a locally normalized softmax layer
on a benchmark dataset.
