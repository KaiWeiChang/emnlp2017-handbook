Abstract#==#Discourse parsing has long been treated as a stand-alone problem independent
from constituency or dependency parsing. Most attempts at this problem rely on
annotated text segmentations (Elementary Discourse Units, EDUs) and
sophisticated sparse or continuous features to extract syntactic information.
In this paper we propose the first end-to-end discourse parser that jointly
parses in both syntax and discourse levels, as well as the first
syntactic-discourse treebank by integrating the Penn Treebank and the RST
Treebank. Built upon our recent span-based constituency parser, this joint
syntactic-discourse parser requires no preprocessing efforts such as
segmentation or feature extraction, making discourse parsing more convenient.
Empirically, our parser achieves the state-of-the-art end-to-end discourse
parsing accuracy.
