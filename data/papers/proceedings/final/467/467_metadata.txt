Abstract#==#We introduce a hierarchical architecture for machine reading capable of
extracting precise information from long documents.
The model divides the document into small, overlapping windows and encodes all
windows in parallel with an RNN.
It then attends over these window encodings, reducing them to a single
encoding, which is decoded into an answer using a sequence decoder.
This hierarchical approach allows the model to scale to longer documents
without increasing the number of sequential steps.
In a supervised setting, our model achieves state of the art accuracy of 76.8
on the WikiReading dataset.
We also evaluate the model in a semi-supervised setting by downsampling the
WikiReading training set to create increasingly smaller amounts of supervision,
while leaving the full unlabeled document corpus to train a sequence
autoencoder on document windows.
We evaluate models that can reuse autoencoder states and outputs without
fine-tuning their weights, allowing for more efficient training and inference.
