Abstract#==#Document-level multi-aspect sentiment classification is an important task for
customer relation management. In this paper, we model the task as a machine
comprehension problem where pseudo question-answer pairs are constructed by a
small number of aspect-related keywords and aspect ratings. A hierarchical
iterative attention model is introduced to build aspectspecific representations
by frequent and repeated interactions between documents and aspect questions.
We adopt a hierarchical architecture to represent both word level and sentence
level information, and use the attention operations for aspect questions and
documents alternatively with the multiple hop mechanism. Experimental results
on the TripAdvisor and BeerAdvocate datasets show that our model outperforms
classical baselines. We will release our code and data for the method
replicability.
