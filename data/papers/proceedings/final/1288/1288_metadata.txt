Abstract#==#Standard accuracy metrics indicate that 
reading comprehension systems are making rapid progress,
but the extent to which these systems truly understand language remains
unclear.
To reward systems with real language understanding abilities,
we propose an adversarial evaluation scheme for the Stanford
Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). 
Our method tests whether systems can answer questions
about paragraphs that contain adversarially inserted sentences,
which are automatically generated to distract computer systems
without changing the correct answer or misleading humans.
In this adversarial setting,
the accuracy of sixteen published models
drops from an average of $75\%$ F1 score to $36\%$;
when the adversary is allowed to add ungrammatical sequences of words,
average accuracy on four models decreases further to $7\%$.
We hope our insights will motivate
the development of new models that
understand language more precisely.
