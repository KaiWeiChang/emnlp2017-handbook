Abstract#==#We introduce a novel iterative approach for event coreference resolution that
gradually builds event clusters by exploiting inter-dependencies among event
mentions within the same chain as well as across event chains. Among event
mentions in the same chain, we distinguish within- and cross-document event
coreference links by using two distinct pairwise classifiers, trained
separately to capture differences in feature distributions of within- and
cross-document event clusters. Our event coreference approach alternates
between WD and CD clustering and combines arguments from both event clusters
after every merge, continuing till no more merge can be made. And then it
performs further merging between event chains that are both closely related to
a set of other chains of events. Experiments on the ECB+ corpus show that our
model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in joint task of WD and CD event
coreference resolution.
