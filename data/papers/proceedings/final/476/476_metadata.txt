Abstract#==#We introduce Zipporah, a fast and scalable data cleaning system. We propose a
novel type of bag-of-words translation feature, and train logistic regression
models to classify good data and synthetic noisy data in the proposed feature
space. The trained model is used to score parallel sentences in the data pool
for selection. As shown in experiments, Zipporah selects a high-quality
parallel corpus from a large, mixed quality data pool. In particular, for one
noisy dataset, Zipporah achieves a 2.1 BLEU score improvement with using 1/5 of
the data over using the entire corpus.
