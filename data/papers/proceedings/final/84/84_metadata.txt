Abstract#==#In this paper, we introduce a new distributional method for modeling
predicate-argument thematic fit judgments. 
We use a syntax-based DSM to build a prototypical representation of
verb-specific roles: for every verb, we extract the most salient second order
contexts for each of its roles (i.e. the most salient dimensions of typical
role fillers), and then we compute thematic fit as a weighted overlap between
the top features of candidate fillers and role prototypes.
Our experiments show that our method consistently outperforms a baseline
re-implementing a state-of-the-art system, and achieves better or comparable
results to those reported in the literature for the other unsupervised systems.
Moreover, it provides an explicit representation of the features characterizing
verb-specific semantic roles.
