Abstract#==#Verbs can only be used with a few specific arrangements of their arguments
(syntactic frames). Most theorists note that verbs can be organized into a
hierarchy of verb classes based on the frames they admit. Here we show that
such a hierarchy is objectively well-supported by the patterns of verbs and
frames in English, since a systematic hierarchical clustering algorithm
converges on the same structure as the handcrafted taxonomy of VerbNet, a
broad-coverage verb lexicon. We also show that the hierarchies capture
meaningful psychological dimensions of generalization by predicting novel verb
coercions by human participants. We discuss limitations of a simple
hierarchical representation and suggest similar approaches for identifying the
representations underpinning verb argument structure.
