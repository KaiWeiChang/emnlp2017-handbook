Abstract#==#We propose an approach to N -best list re-
ranking using neural sequence-labelling
models. We train a compositional model
for error detection that calculates the prob-
ability of each token in a sentence being
correct or incorrect, utilising the full sen-
tence as context. Using the error detec-
tion model, we then re-rank the N best
hypotheses generated by statistical ma-
chine translation systems. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art results on error
correction for three different datasets, and
it has the additional advantage of only us-
ing a small set of easily computed features
that require no linguistic input.
