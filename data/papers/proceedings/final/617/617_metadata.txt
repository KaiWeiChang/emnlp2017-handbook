Abstract#==#We propose an efficient method to conduct phrase alignment on parse forests for
paraphrase detection. Unlike previous studies, our method identifies syntactic
paraphrases under linguistically motivated grammar. In addition, it allows
phrases to non-compositionally align to handle paraphrases with non-homographic
phrase correspondences. 

A dataset that provides gold parse trees and their phrase alignments is
created. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method conducts
highly accurate phrase alignment compared to human performance.
