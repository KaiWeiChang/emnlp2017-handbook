Abstract#==#For the task of relation extraction, distant supervision is an efficient
approach to generate labeled data by aligning knowledge base with free texts.
The essence of it is a challenging incomplete multi-label classification
problem with sparse and noisy features. To address the challenge, this work
presents a novel nonparametric Bayesian formulation for the task. Experiment
results show substantially higher top precision improvements over the
traditional state-of-the-art approaches.
