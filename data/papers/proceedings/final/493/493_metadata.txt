Abstract#==#In this paper we propose an end-to-end neural CRF autoencoder (NCRF-AE) model
for semi-supervised learning of sequential structured prediction problems. Our
NCRF-AE consists of two parts: an encoder which is a CRF model enhanced by deep
neural networks, and a decoder which is a generative model trying to
reconstruct the input. Our model has a unified structure with different loss
functions for labeled and unlabeled data with shared parameters. We developed a
variation of the EM algorithm for optimizing both the encoder and the decoder
simultaneously by decoupling their parameters. Our Experimental results over
the Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging task on eight different languages, show that
our model can outperform competitive systems in both supervised and
semi-supervised scenarios.
