Abstract#==#Experimenting with a new dataset of 1.6M
user comments from a news portal and an
existing dataset of 115K Wikipedia talk
page comments, we show that an RNN operating
on word embeddings outpeforms
the previous state of the art in moderation,
which used logistic regression or an MLP
classifier with character or word n-grams.
We also compare against a CNN operating
on word embeddings, and a word-list
baseline. A novel, deep, classificationspecific
attention mechanism improves the
performance of the RNN further, and can
also highlight suspicious words for free,
without including highlighted words in the
training data. We consider both fully automatic
and semi-automatic moderation.
