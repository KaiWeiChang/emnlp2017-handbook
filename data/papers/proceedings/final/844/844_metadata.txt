Abstract#==#Sequence-to-sequence models have been applied to the conversation response
generation problem where the source sequence is the conversation history and
the target sequence is the response. Unlike translation, conversation
responding is inherently creative. The generation of long, informative,
coherent, and diverse responses remains a hard task.
In this work, we focus on the single turn setting. We add self-attention to the
decoder to maintain coherence in longer responses, and we propose a practical
approach, called the glimpse-model, for scaling to large datasets. We introduce
a stochastic beam-search algorithm with segment-by-segment reranking which lets
us inject diversity earlier in the generation process. We trained on a combined
data set of over 2.3B conversation messages mined from the web. In human
evaluation studies, our method produces longer responses overall, with a higher
proportion rated as acceptable and excellent as length increases, compared to
baseline sequence-to-sequence models with explicit length-promotion. A back-off
strategy produces better responses overall, in the full spectrum of lengths.
