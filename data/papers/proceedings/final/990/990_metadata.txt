Abstract#==#Many Natural Language Processing (NLP) models rely on distributed vector
representations of words.  Because the process of training word vectors can
require large amounts of data and computation, NLP researchers and
practitioners often utilize pre-trained embeddings downloaded from the Web. 
However, finding the best embeddings for a given task is difficult, and can be
computationally prohibitive.  We present a framework, called VecShare, that
makes it easy to share and retrieve word embeddings on the Web.  The framework
leverages a public data-sharing infrastructure to host embedding sets, and
provides automated mechanisms for retrieving the embeddings most similar to a
given corpus.  We perform an experimental evaluation of VecShare's similarity
strategies, and show that they are effective at efficiently retrieving
embeddings that boost accuracy in a document classification task.  Finally, we
provide an open-source Python library for using the VecShare framework.
