Abstract#==#Search engines play an important role in our everyday lives by assisting us in
finding the information we need. When we input a complex query, however,
results are often far from satisfactory. In this work, we introduce a query
reformulation system based on a neural network that rewrites a query to
maximize the number of relevant documents returned.
We train this neural network with reinforcement learning. The actions
correspond to selecting terms to build a reformulated query, and the reward is
the document recall. We evaluate our approach on three datasets against strong
baselines and show a relative improvement of 5-20% in terms of recall.
Furthermore, we present a simple method to estimate a conservative upper-bound
performance of a model in a particular environment and verify that there is
still large room for improvements.
