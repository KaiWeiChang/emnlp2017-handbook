Abstract#==#Source dependency information has been successfully introduced into statistical
machine translation. However, there are only a few preliminary attempts for
Neural Machine Translation (NMT), such as concatenating representations of
source word and its dependency label together. In this paper, we propose a
novel NMT with source dependency representation to improve translation
performance of NMT, especially long sentences. Empirical results on NIST
Chinese-to-English translation task show that our method achieves 1.6 BLEU
improvements on average over a strong NMT system.
