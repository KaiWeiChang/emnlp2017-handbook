Abstract#==#We introduce the task of book structure labeling: segmenting and assigning a
fixed category (such as Table of Contents, Preface, Index) to the document
structure of printed books.  We manually annotate the page-level structural
categories for a large dataset totaling 294,816 pages in 1,055 books evenly
sampled from 1750-1922, and present empirical results comparing the performance
of several classes of models.  The best-performing model, a bidirectional LSTM
with rich features, achieves an overall accuracy of 95.8 and a class-balanced
macro F-score of 71.4.
