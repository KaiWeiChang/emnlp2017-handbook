Abstract#==#Current word alignment models do not distinguish between different types of
alignment links. In this paper, we provide a new probabilistic model for word
alignment where word alignments are associated with linguistically motivated
alignment types. We propose a novel task of joint prediction of word alignment
and alignment types and propose novel semi-supervised learning algorithms for
this task. We also solve a sub-task of predicting the alignment type given an
aligned word pair. In our experimental results, the generative models we
introduce to model alignment types significantly outperform the models without
alignment types.
