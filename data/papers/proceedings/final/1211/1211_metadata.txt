Abstract#==#Vector representation of words improves performance in various NLP tasks, but
the high dimensional word vectors are very difficult to interpret. We apply
several rotation algorithms to the vector representation of words to improve
the interpretability. Unlike previous approaches that induce sparsity, the
rotated vectors are interpretable while preserving the expressive performance
of the original vectors. Furthermore, any prebuilt word vector representation
can be rotated for improved interpretability. We apply rotation to skipgrams
and glove and compare the expressive power and interpretability with the
original vectors and the sparse overcomplete vectors. The results show that the
rotated vectors outperform the original and the sparse overcomplete vectors for
interpretability and expressiveness tasks.
