Abstract#==#Questions play a prominent role in social interactions, performing rhetorical
functions that go beyond that of simple informational exchange.  The surface
form of a question can signal the intention and background of the person asking
it, as well as the nature of their relation with the interlocutor.  While the
informational nature of questions has been extensively examined in the context
of question-answering applications, their rhetorical aspects have been largely
understudied.

In this work we introduce an unsupervised methodology for extracting surface
motifs that recur in questions, and for grouping them according to their latent
rhetorical role.  By applying this framework to the setting of question
sessions in the UK parliament, we show that the resulting typology encodes key
aspects of the political discourse---such as the bifurcation in questioning
behavior between government and opposition parties---and reveals new insights
into the effects of a legislator's tenure and political career ambitions.
