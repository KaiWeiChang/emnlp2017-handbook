Abstract#==#Document-level sentiment classification is a fundamental problem which aims to
predict a user's overall sentiment about a 
product in a document. Several methods have been proposed to tackle the problem
whereas most of them fail to consider the influence of users who express the
sentiment and products which are evaluated. To address the issue,
we propose a deep memory network for document-level sentiment classification
which could capture the user and product information at the same time. To prove
the effectiveness of our algorithm, we conduct experiments on IMDB and Yelp
datasets and the results indicate that our model can achieve better performance
than several existing methods.
