Abstract#==#We present a machine learning analysis of eye-tracking data for the detection
of mild cognitive impairment, a decline in cognitive abilities that is
associated with an increased risk of developing dementia. We compare two
experimental configurations (reading aloud versus reading silently), as well as
two methods of combining information from the two trials (concatenation and
merging). Additionally, we annotate the words being read with information about
their frequency and syntactic category, and use these annotations to generate
new features. Ultimately, we are able to distinguish between participants with
and without cognitive impairment with up to 86% accuracy.
