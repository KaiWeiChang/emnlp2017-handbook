Abstract#==#Adversarial training is a mean of regularizing classification algorithms by
generating adversarial noise to the training data. We apply adversarial
training in relation extraction within the multi-instance multi-label learning
framework. We evaluate various neural network architectures on two different
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that adversarial training is
generally effective for both CNN and RNN models and significantly improves the
precision of predicted relations.
