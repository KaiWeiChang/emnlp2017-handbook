Abstract#==#This paper proposes to tackle the AMR parsing bottleneck by improving two
components of an AMR parser: concept identification and alignment. We first
build a Bidirectional LSTM based concept identifier that is able to incorporate
richer contextual information to learn sparse AMR concept labels. We then
extend an HMM-based word-to-concept alignment model with graph distance
distortion and a rescoring method during decoding to incorporate the structural
information in the AMR graph. We show integrating the two components into an
existing AMR parser results in consistently better performance over the state
of the art on various datasets.
