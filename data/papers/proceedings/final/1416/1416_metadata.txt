Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose a novel method for combining deep learning and
classical feature based models using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network for
financial sentiment analysis. We develop various deep learning models based on
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated
Recurrent Unit (GRU). These are trained on top of pre-trained,
autoencoder-based, financial word embeddings and lexicon features. An ensemble
is constructed by combining these deep learning models and a classical
supervised model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR). We evaluate our
proposed technique on a benchmark dataset of SemEval-2017 shared task on
financial sentiment analysis. The propose model shows impressive results on two
datasets, i.e. microblogs and news headlines datasets. Comparisons show that
our proposed model performs better than the existing state-of-the-art systems
for the above two datasets by 2.0 and 4.1 cosine points, respectively.
