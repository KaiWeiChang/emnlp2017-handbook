Abstract#==#A taxonomy is a semantic hierarchy, consisting of concepts linked by is-a
relations. While a large number of taxonomies have been constructed from
human-compiled resources (e.g., Wikipedia), learning taxonomies from text
corpora has received a growing interest and is essential for long-tailed and
domain-specific knowledge acquisition. In this paper, we overview recent
advances on taxonomy construction from free texts, reorganizing relevant
subtasks into a complete framework. We also overview resources for evaluation
and discuss challenges for future research.
