Abstract#==#Recent years have witnessed the proliferation of Massive Open Online Courses
(MOOCs). With massive learners being offered MOOCs, there is a demand that the
forum contents within MOOCs need to be classified in order to facilitate both
learners and instructors. Therefore we investigate a significant application,
which is to associate forum threads to subtitles of video clips. This task can
be regarded as a document ranking problem, and the key is how to learn a
distinguishable text representation from word sequences and learners' behavior
sequences. In this paper, we propose a novel cascade model, which can capture
both the latent semantics and latent similarity by modeling MOOC data.
Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our textual
representation outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts for the
application.
