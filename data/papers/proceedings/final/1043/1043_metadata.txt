Abstract#==#In order to determine argument structure in text, one must understand how
individual components of the overall argument are linked. This work presents
the first neural network-based approach to link extraction in argument mining.
Specifically, we propose a novel architecture that applies Pointer Network
sequence-to-sequence attention modeling to structural prediction in discourse
parsing tasks. We then develop a joint model that extends this architecture to
simultaneously address the link extraction task and the classification of
argument components. The proposed joint model achieves state-of-the-art results
on two separate evaluation corpora, showing far superior performance than the
previously proposed corpus-specific and heavily feature-engineered models.
Furthermore, our results demonstrate that jointly optimizing for both tasks is
crucial for high performance.
