Abstract#==#Training a POS tagging model with crosslingual transfer learning usually
requires linguistic knowledge and resources about the relation between the
source language and the target language. In this paper, we introduce a
cross-lingual transfer learning model for POS tagging without ancillary
resources such as parallel corpora. The proposed cross-lingual model utilizes a
common BLSTM that enables knowledge transfer from other languages, and private
BLSTMs for language-specific representations. The cross-lingual model is
trained with language-adversarial training and bidirectional language modeling
as auxiliary objectives to better represent language-general information while
not losing the information about a specific target language. Evaluating on POS
datasets from 14 languages in the Universal Dependencies corpus, we show that
the proposed transfer learning model improves
the POS tagging performance of the target languages without exploiting any
linguistic knowledge between the source language and the target language.
