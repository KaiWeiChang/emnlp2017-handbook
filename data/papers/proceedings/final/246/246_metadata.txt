Abstract#==#When people recall and digest what they have read for writing summaries, the
important content is more likely to attract their attention.
  Inspired by this observation, we propose a cascaded attention based
unsupervised
  model to estimate the salience information from the text for compressive
multi-document summarization.
  The attention weights are learned automatically by an unsupervised data
reconstruction framework which can capture the sentence salience.
  By adding sparsity constraints on the number of output vectors, we can
generate condensed information which can be treated as word salience.
  Fine-grained and coarse-grained sentence compression strategies are
incorporated to produce compressive summaries. 
  Experiments on some benchmark data sets show that our framework achieves
better results than the state-of-the-art methods.
