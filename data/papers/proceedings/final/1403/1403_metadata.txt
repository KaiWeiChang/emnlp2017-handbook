Abstract#==#Hand-crafted rules and reinforcement learning (RL) are two popular choices to
obtain dialogue policy.  The rule-based policy is often reliable within
predefined scope but not self-adaptable, whereas RL is evolvable with data but
often suffers from a bad initial performance. We employ a {\em companion
learning} framework to integrate the two approaches for {\em on-line} dialogue
policy learning, in which a pre-defined rule-based policy acts as a
“teacher” and guides a data-driven RL system by giving example actions as
well as additional rewards. A novel {\em agent-aware dropout} Deep Q-Network
(AAD-DQN) is proposed to address the problem of when to consult the teacher and
how to learn from the teacher's experiences. AAD-DQN, as a data-driven student
policy, provides (1) two separate experience memories for student and teacher,
(2) an uncertainty estimated by dropout to control the timing of consultation
and learning. Simulation experiments showed that the proposed approach can
significantly improve both {\em safety} and {\em efficiency} of on-line policy
optimization compared to other companion learning approaches as well as
supervised pre-training using static dialogue corpus.
