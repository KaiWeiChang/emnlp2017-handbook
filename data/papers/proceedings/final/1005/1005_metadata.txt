Abstract#==#Today when many practitioners run basic NLP on the entire web and large-volume
traffic, faster methods are paramount to saving time and energy costs.
Recent advances in GPU hardware have led to the emergence of bi-directional
LSTMs as a standard method for obtaining per-token vector representations
serving as input to labeling tasks such as NER (often followed by prediction in
a linear-chain CRF). 
Though expressive and accurate, these models fail to fully exploit GPU
parallelism, limiting their computational efficiency.
This paper proposes a faster alternative to Bi-LSTMs for NER: Iterated Dilated
Convolutional Neural Networks (ID-CNNs), which have better capacity than
traditional CNNs for large context and structured prediction.  
Unlike LSTMs whose sequential processing on sentences of length N requires O(N)
time even in the face of parallelism, ID-CNNs permit fixed-depth convolutions
to run in parallel across entire documents.
We describe a distinct combination of network structure, parameter sharing and
training procedures that enable dramatic 14-20x test-time speedups while
retaining accuracy comparable to the Bi-LSTM-CRF. Moreover, ID-CNNs trained to
aggregate context from the entire document are more accurate than Bi-LSTM-CRFs
while attaining 8x faster test time speeds.
