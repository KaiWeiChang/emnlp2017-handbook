Abstract#==#The framing of an action influences how we perceive its actor. We introduce
connotation frames of power and agency, a pragmatic formalism organized using
frame semantic representations, to model how different levels of power and
agency are implicitly projected on actors through their actions. We use the new
power and agency frames to measure the subtle, but prevalent, gender bias in
the portrayal of modern film characters and provide insights that deviate from
the well-known Bechdel test. Our contributions include an extended lexicon of
connotation frames along with a web interface that provides a comprehensive
analysis through the lens of connotation frames.
