Abstract#==#In the logic approach to Recognizing Textual Entailment, identifying
phrase-to-phrase semantic relations is still an unsolved problem. Resources
such as the Paraphrase Database offer limited coverage despite their large size
whereas unsupervised distributional models of meaning often fail to recognize
phrasal entailments. We propose to map phrases to their visual denotations and
compare their meaning in terms of their images. We show that our approach is
effective in the task of Recognizing Textual Entailment when combined with
specific linguistic and logic features.
