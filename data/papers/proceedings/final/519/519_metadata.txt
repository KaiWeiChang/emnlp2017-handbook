Abstract#==#We present an unsupervised model of dialogue act sequences in conversation. By
modeling topical themes as transitioning more slowly than dialogue acts in
conversation, our model de-emphasizes content-related words in order to focus
on conversational function words that signal dialogue acts. We also incorporate
speaker tendencies to use some acts more than others as an additional predictor
of dialogue act prevalence beyond temporal dependencies. According to the
evaluation presented on two dissimilar corpora, the CNET forum and NPS Chat
corpus, the effectiveness of each modeling assumption is found to vary
depending on characteristics of the data. De-emphasizing content-related words
yields improvement on the CNET corpus, while utilizing speaker tendencies is
advantageous on the NPS corpus. The components of our model complement one
another to achieve robust performance on both corpora and outperform
state-of-the-art baseline models.
