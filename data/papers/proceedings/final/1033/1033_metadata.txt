Abstract#==#We present a new semantic parsing model for answering compositional questions
on semi-structured Wikipedia tables. Our parser is an encoder-decoder neural
network with two key technical innovations: (1) a grammar for the decoder that
only generates well-typed logical forms; and (2) an entity embedding and
linking module that identifies entity mentions while generalizing across
tables. We also introduce a novel method for training our neural model with
question-answer supervision. On the WikiTableQuestions data set, our parser
achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 43.3% for a single model and 45.9% for
a 5-model ensemble, improving on the best prior score of 38.7% set by a
15-model ensemble. These results suggest that type constraints and entity
linking are valuable components to incorporate in neural semantic parsers.
