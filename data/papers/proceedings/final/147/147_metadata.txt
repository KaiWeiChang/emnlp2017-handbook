Abstract#==#In this paper we investigate a new task of automatically constructing an
overview article from a given set of news articles about a news event.
We propose a news synthesis approach to address this task based on passage
segmentation, ranking, selection and merging.
Our proposed approach is compared with several typical multi-document
summarization methods on the Wikinews dataset, and achieves the best
performance on both automatic evaluation and manual evaluation.
