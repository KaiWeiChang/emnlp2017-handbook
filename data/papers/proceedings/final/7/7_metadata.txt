Abstract#==#In this paper, we make a simple observation that questions about images often
contain premises – objects and relationships implied by the question – and
that reasoning about premises can help Visual Question Answering (VQA) models
respond more intelligently to irrelevant or previously unseen questions.

When presented with a question that is irrelevant to an image, state-of-the-art
VQA models will still answer purely based on learned language biases, resulting
in non-sensical or even misleading answers. We note that a visual question is
irrelevant to an image if at least one of its premises is false (i.e. not
depicted in the image). We leverage this observation to construct a dataset for
Question Relevance Prediction and Explanation (QRPE) by searching for false
premises. We train novel question relevance detection models and show that
models that reason about premises consistently outperform models that do not.

We also find that forcing standard VQA models to reason about premises during
training can lead to improvements on tasks requiring compositional reasoning.
