Abstract#==#Semantic role labeling (SRL) is the task of identifying the predicate-argument
structure of a sentence. 
It is typically regarded as an important step in the standard NLP pipeline.
As the semantic representations are closely related to syntactic ones, we
exploit syntactic information in our model.  
We propose a version of graph convolutional networks (GCNs), a recent class of
neural networks operating on graphs, suited to model syntactic dependency
graphs. 
GCNs over syntactic dependency trees are used as sentence encoders, producing
latent feature representations of words in a sentence.
We observe that GCN layers are complementary to LSTM ones: when we stack both
GCN and LSTM layers, we obtain a substantial improvement over an already
state-of-the-art LSTM SRL model, resulting in the best reported scores on the
standard benchmark (CoNLL-2009) both for Chinese and English.
