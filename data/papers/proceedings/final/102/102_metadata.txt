Abstract#==#Word embeddings have attracted much attention recently. Different from
alphabetic writing systems, Chinese characters are often composed of
subcharacter components which are also semantically informative. In this work,
we propose an approach to jointly embed Chinese words as well as their
characters and fine-grained subcharacter components. We use three likelihoods
to evaluate whether the context words, characters, and components can predict
the current target word, and collected 13,253 subcharacter components to
demonstrate the existing approaches of decomposing Chinese characters are not
enough. Evaluation on both word similarity and word analogy tasks demonstrates
the superior performance of our model.
