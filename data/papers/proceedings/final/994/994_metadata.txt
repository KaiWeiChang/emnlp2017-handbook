Abstract#==#This paper presents a novel neural machine translation model which jointly
learns translation and source-side latent graph representations of sentences.
Unlike existing pipelined approaches using syntactic parsers, our end-to-end
model learns a latent graph parser as part of the encoder of an attention-based
neural machine translation model, and thus the parser is optimized according to
the translation objective.
In experiments, we first show that our model compares favorably with
state-of-the-art sequential and pipelined syntax-based NMT models.
We also show that the performance of our model can be further improved by
pre-training it with a small amount of treebank annotations.
Our final ensemble model significantly outperforms the previous best models on
the standard English-to-Japanese translation dataset.
