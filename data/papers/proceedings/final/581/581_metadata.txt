Abstract#==#Highlighting the recurrence of topics usage in candidates speeches is a key
feature to identify the main ideas of each candidate during a political
campaign. In this paper, we present a method combining standard topic modeling
with signature mining for analyzing topic recurrence in speeches of Clinton and
Trump during the 2016 American presidential campaign. The results show that the
method extracts automatically the main ideas of each candidate and, in
addition, provides information about the evolution of these topics during the
campaign.
