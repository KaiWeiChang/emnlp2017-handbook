Abstract#==#We first present a minimal feature set for transition-based dependency parsing,
continuing a recent trend started by Kiperwasser and Goldberg (2016a) and Cross
and Huang (2016a) of using bi-directional LSTM features. We plug our minimal
feature set into the dynamic-programming framework of Huang and Sagae (2010)
and Kuhlmann et al. (2011) to produce the first implementation of worst-case
O(n^3) exact decoders for arc-hybrid and arc-eager transition systems. With our
minimal features, we also present O(n^3) global training methods. Finally,
using ensembles including our new parsers, we achieve the best unlabeled
attachment score reported (to our knowledge) on the Chinese Treebank and the
``second-best-in-class'' result on the English Penn Treebank.
