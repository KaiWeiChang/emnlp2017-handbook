Abstract#==#There has been a recent line of work automatically learning scripts from
unstructured texts, by modeling narrative event chains. While the dominant
approach group events using event pair relations, LSTMs have been used to
encode full chains of narrative events. The latter has the advantage of
learning long-range temporal orders, yet the former is more adaptive to partial
orders. We propose a neural model that leverages the advantages of both
methods, by using LSTM hidden states as features for event pair modelling. A
dynamic memory network is utilized to automatically induce weights on existing
events for inferring a subsequent event. Standard evaluation shows that our
method significantly outperforms both methods above, giving the best results
reported so far.
