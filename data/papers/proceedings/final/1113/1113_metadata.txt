Abstract#==#Discourse segmentation is the first step in building discourse parsers. Most
work on discourse segmentation does not scale to real-world discourse parsing
across languages, for two reasons: (i) models rely on constituent trees, and
(ii) experiments have relied on gold standard identification of sentence and
token boundaries. We therefore investigate to what extent constituents can be
replaced with universal dependencies, or left out completely, as well as how
state-of-the-art segmenters fare in the absence of sentence boundaries. Our
results show that dependency information is less useful than expected, but we
provide a fully scalable, robust model that only relies on part-of-speech
information, and show that it performs well across languages in the absence of
any gold-standard annotation.
