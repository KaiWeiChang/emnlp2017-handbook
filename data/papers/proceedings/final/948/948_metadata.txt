Abstract#==#We study the problem of identifying the topics and sentiments and tracking
their shifts from social media texts in different geographical regions during
emergencies and disasters. We propose a location-based dynamic sentiment-topic
model (LDST) which can jointly model topic, sentiment, time and Geolocation
information. The experimental results demonstrate that LDST performs very well
at discovering topics and sentiments from social media and tracking their
shifts in different geographical regions during emergencies and disasters. We
will release the data and source code after this work is published.
