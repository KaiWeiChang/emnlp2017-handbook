Abstract#==#Crowdsourcing has proven to be an effective method for generating labeled data
for a range of NLP tasks. However, multiple recent attempts of using
crowdsourcing to generate gold-labeled training data for semantic role labeling
(SRL) reported only modest results, indicating that SRL is perhaps too
difficult a task to be effectively crowdsourced. In this paper, we postulate
that while producing SRL annotation does require expert involvement in general,
a large subset of SRL labeling tasks is in fact appropriate for the crowd. We
present a novel workflow in which we employ a classifier to identify difficult
annotation tasks and route each task either to experts or crowd workers
according to their difficulties. Our experimental evaluation shows that the
proposed approach reduces the workload for experts by over two-thirds, and thus
significantly reduces the cost of producing SRL annotation at little loss in
quality.
