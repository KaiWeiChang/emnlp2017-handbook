Abstract#==#Much of our online communication is text-mediated and, lately, more common with
automated agents. Unlike interacting with humans, these agents currently do not
tailor their language to the type of person they are communicating to. In this
pilot study, we measure the extent to which human perception of basic user
trait information -- gender and age -- is controllable through text. Using
automatic models of gender and age prediction, we estimate which tweets posted
by a user are more likely to mis-characterize his traits. We perform multiple
controlled crowdsourcing experiments in which we show that we can reduce the
human prediction accuracy of gender to almost random -- an over 20\% drop in
accuracy. Our experiments show that it is practically feasible for multiple
applications such as text generation, text summarization or machine translation
to be tailored to specific traits and perceived as such.
