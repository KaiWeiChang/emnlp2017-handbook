Abstract#==#We study the problem of learning to reason in large scale knowledge graphs
(KGs). More specifically, we describe a novel reinforcement learning framework
for learning multi-hop relational paths: we use a policy-based agent with
continuous states based on knowledge graph embeddings, which reasons in a KG
vector-space by sampling the most promising relation to extend its path. In
contrast to prior work, our approach includes a reward function that takes the
accuracy, diversity, and efficiency into consideration. Experimentally, we show
that our proposed method outperforms a path-ranking based algorithm and
knowledge graph embedding methods on Freebase and Never-Ending Language
Learning datasets.
