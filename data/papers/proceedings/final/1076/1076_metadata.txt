Abstract#==#Understanding a long document requires tracking how entities are introduced and
evolve over time. We present a new type of language model, EntityNLM, that can
explicitly model entities, dynamically update their representations, and
contextually generate their mentions. Our model is generative and flexible; it
can model an arbitrary number of entities in context while generating each
entity mention at an arbitrary length. In addition, it can be used for several
different tasks such as language modeling, coreference resolution, and entity
prediction. Experimental results with all these tasks demonstrate that our
model consistently outperforms strong baselines and prior work.
