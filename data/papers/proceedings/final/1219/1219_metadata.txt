Abstract#==#Deep neural networks for machine comprehension typically utilizes only word or
character embeddings without explicitly taking advantage of structured
linguistic information such as constituency trees and dependency trees. In this
paper, we propose structural embedding of syntactic trees (SEST), an algorithm
framework to utilize structured information and encode them into vector
representations that can boost the performance of algorithms for the machine
comprehension. We evaluate our approach using a state-of-the-art neural
attention model on the SQuAD dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model can accurately identify the syntactic boundaries of the sentences and
extract answers that are syntactically coherent over the baseline methods.
