Abstract#==#We propose a new, socially-impactful task for natural language processing: from
a news corpus, extract names of persons who have been killed by police. We
present a newly collected police fatality corpus, which we release publicly,
and present a model to solve this problem that uses EM-based distant
supervision with logistic regression and convolutional neural network
classifiers. Our model outperforms two off-the-shelf event extractor systems,
and it can suggest candidate victim names in some cases faster than one of the
major manually-collected police fatality databases.
