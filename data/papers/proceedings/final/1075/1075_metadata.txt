Abstract#==#Models work best when they are optimized taking into account the evaluation
criteria that people care about. For topic models, people often care about
interpretability, which can be approximated using measures of lexical
association. We integrate lexical association into topic optimization using
tree priors, which provide a flexible framework that can take advantage of both
first order word associations and the higher-order associations captured by
word embeddings. Tree priors improve topic interpretability without hurting
extrinsic performance.
