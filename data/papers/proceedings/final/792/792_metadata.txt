Abstract#==#Variations of word associations across different groups of people can provide
insights into peopleâ€™s psychologies and their world views. To capture these
variations, we introduce the task of demographic-aware word associations. We
build a new gold standard dataset consisting of word association responses for
approximately 300 stimulus words, collected from more than 800 respondents of
different gender (male/female) and from different locations (India/United
States), and show that there are significant variations in the word
associations made by these groups. We also introduce a new demographic-aware
word association model based on a neural net skip-gram architecture, and show
how computational methods for measuring word associations that specifically
account for writer demographics can outperform generic methods that are
agnostic to such information.
