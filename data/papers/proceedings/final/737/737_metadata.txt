Abstract#==#Domain similarity measures can be used to gauge adaptability and select
suitable data for transfer learning, but existing approaches define ad hoc
measures that are deemed suitable for respective tasks. Inspired by work on
curriculum learning, we propose to learn data selection measures using Bayesian
Optimization and evaluate them across models, domains and tasks.
Our learned measures outperform existing domain similarity measures
significantly on three tasks: sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and
parsing.  We show the importance of complementing similarity with diversity,
and that learned measures are--to some degree--transferable across models,
domains, and even tasks.
