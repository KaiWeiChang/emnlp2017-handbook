Abstract#==#Monolingual evaluation of Machine Translation (MT) aims to simplify human
assessment by requiring assessors to compare the meaning of the MT output with
a reference
translation, opening up the task to a much larger pool of genuinely qualified
evaluators. Monolingual evaluation runs the risk, however, of bias in favour of
MT systems that happen to produce translations superficially similar to the
reference and, consistent with this intuition, previous investigations have
concluded monolingual assessment to be strongly biased in this respect. On
re-examination of past analyses, we identify a series of potential analytical
errors that force some important questions to be raised about the reliability
of past conclusions, however. We subsequently carry out further investigation
into reference bias via direct human assessment of MT adequacy via quality
controlled crowd-sourcing. Contrary to both intuition and past conclusions,
results for show no significant evidence of reference bias
in monolingual evaluation of MT.
