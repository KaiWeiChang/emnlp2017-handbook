Abstract#==#In state-of-the-art Neural Machine Trans-
lation (NMT), an attention mechanism is
used during decoding to enhance the trans-
lation. At every step, the decoder uses this
mechanism to focus on different parts of
the source sentence to gather the most use-
ful information before outputting its tar-
get word. Recently, the effectiveness of
the attention mechanism has also been ex-
plored for multi-modal tasks, where it be-
comes possible to focus both on sentence
parts and image regions that they describe.
In this paper, we compare several atten-
tion mechanism on the multi-modal trans-
lation task (English, image → German)
and evaluate the ability of the model to
make use of images to improve translation.
We surpass state-of-the-art scores on the
Multi30k data set, we nevertheless iden-
tify and report different misbehavior of the
machine while translating.
