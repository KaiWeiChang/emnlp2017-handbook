Abstract#==#We present an analytic study on the language of news media in the context of
political fact-checking and fake news detection. We compare the language of
real news with that of satire, hoaxes, and propaganda to find linguistic
characteristics of untrustworthy text. To probe the feasibility of automatic
political fact-checking, we also present a case study based on PolitiFact.com
using their factuality judgments on a 6-point scale. Experiments show that
while media fact-checking remains to be an open research question, stylistic
cues can help determine the truthfulness of text.
