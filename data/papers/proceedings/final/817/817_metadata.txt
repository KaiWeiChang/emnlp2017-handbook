Abstract#==#Existing approaches to automatic VerbNet-style verb classification are heavily
dependent on feature engineering and therefore limited to languages with mature
NLP pipelines. In this work, we propose a novel cross-lingual transfer method
for inducing VerbNets for multiple languages. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study which demonstrates how the architectures for learning
word embeddings can be applied to this challenging syntactic-semantic task. Our
method uses cross-lingual translation pairs to tie each of the six target
languages into a bilingual vector space with English, jointly specialising the
representations to encode the relational information from English VerbNet. A
standard clustering algorithm is then run on top of the VerbNet-specialised
representations, using vector dimensions as features for learning verb classes.
Our results show that the proposed cross-lingual transfer approach sets new
state-of-the-art verb classification performance across all six target
languages explored in this work.
