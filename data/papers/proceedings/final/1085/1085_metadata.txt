Abstract#==#We present a model for locating regions in space based on natural language
descriptions. Starting with a 3D scene and a sentence, our model is able to
associate words in the sentence with regions in the scene, interpret relations
such as `on top of' or `next to,' and finally locate the region described in
the sentence. All components form a single neural network that is trained
end-to-end without prior knowledge of object segmentation. To evaluate our
model, we construct and release a new dataset consisting of Minecraft scenes
with crowdsourced natural language descriptions. We achieve a 32% relative
error reduction compared to a strong neural baseline.
