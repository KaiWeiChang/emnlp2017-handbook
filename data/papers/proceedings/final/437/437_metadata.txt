Abstract#==#Sentence simplification aims to make sentences easier to read and
  understand. Most recent approaches draw on insights from machine
  translation to learn simplification rewrites from monolingual
  corpora of complex and simple sentences. We address the
  simplification problem with an encoder-decoder model coupled with a
  deep reinforcement learning framework. Our model, which we call {\sc
    Dress} (as shorthand for {\bf D}eep {\bf RE}inforcement {\bf
    S}entence {\bf S}implification), explores the space of possible
  simplifications while learning to optimize a reward function that
  encourages outputs which are simple, fluent, and preserve the
  meaning of the input. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that
  our model outperforms competitive simplification
  systems.
