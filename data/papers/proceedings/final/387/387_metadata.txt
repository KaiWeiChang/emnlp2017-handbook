Abstract#==#The majority of NLG evaluation relies on automatic metrics, such as BLEU . In
this paper, we motivate the need for novel, system- and data-independent
automatic evaluation methods: We investigate a wide range of metrics, including
state-of-the-art word-based and novel grammar-based ones, and demonstrate that
they only weakly reflect human judgements of system outputs as generated by
data-driven, end-to-end NLG. We also show that metric performance is data- and
system-specific. Nevertheless, our results also suggest that automatic metrics
perform reliably at system-level and can support system development by finding
cases where a system performs poorly.
