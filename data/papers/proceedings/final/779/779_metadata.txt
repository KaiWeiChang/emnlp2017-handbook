Abstract#==#Resolving abstract anaphora is an important, but difficult task for text
understanding. Yet, with recent advances in representation learning this task
becomes a more tangible aim. A central property of abstract anaphora is that it
establishes a relation between the anaphor embedded in the anaphoric sentence
and its (typically non-nominal) antecedent. We propose a mention-ranking model
that learns how abstract anaphors relate to their antecedents with an
LSTM-Siamese Net. We overcome the lack of training data by generating
artificial anaphoric sentence--antecedent pairs. Our model outperforms
state-of-the-art results on shell noun resolution. We  also report first
benchmark results on an abstract anaphora subset of the ARRAU corpus. This
corpus presents a greater challenge due to a mixture of nominal and pronominal
anaphors and a greater range of confounders. We found model variants that
outperform the baselines for nominal anaphors, without training on individual
anaphor data, but still lag behind for pronominal anaphors. Our model selects
syntactically plausible candidates and -- if disregarding syntax --
discriminates candidates using deeper features.
