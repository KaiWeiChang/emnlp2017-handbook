Abstract#==#The charge prediction task is to determine appropriate charges for a given
case, which is helpful for legal assistant systems where the user input is fact
description. We argue that relevant law articles play an important role in this
task, and therefore propose an attention-based neural network method to jointly
model the charge prediction task and the relevant article extraction task in a
unified framework. The experimental results show that, besides providing legal
basis, the relevant articles can also clearly improve the charge prediction
results, and our full model can effectively predict appropriate charges for
cases with different expression styles.
