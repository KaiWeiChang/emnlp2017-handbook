Abstract#==#n this paper, we present a set of computational methods to identify the
likeliness of a word being borrowed, based on the signals from social media. In
terms of Spearman’s correlation values, our methods perform more than two
times better (∼ 0.62) in predicting the borrowing likeliness compared to the
best performing baseline (∼ 0.26) reported in literature. Based on this
likeliness estimate we asked annotators to re-annotate the language tags of
foreign words in predominantly native contexts. In 88% of cases the annotators
felt that the foreign language tag should be replaced by native language tag,
thus indicating a huge scope for improvement of automatic language
identification systems.
