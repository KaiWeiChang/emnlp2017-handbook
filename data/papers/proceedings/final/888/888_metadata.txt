Abstract#==#Despite their ubiquity, word embeddings trained with skip-gram negative
sampling (SGNS) remain poorly understood. We find that vector positions are not
simply determined by semantic similarity, but rather occupy a narrow cone,
diametrically opposed to the context vectors. We show that this geometric
concentration depends on the ratio of positive to negative examples, and that
it is neither theoretically nor empirically inherent in related embedding
algorithms.
