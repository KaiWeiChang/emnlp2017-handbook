Abstract#==#This article evaluates three proposed laws of semantic change. Our claim is
that in order to validate a putative law of semantic change, the effect should
be observed in the genuine condition but absent or reduced in a suitably
matched control condition, in which no change can possibly have taken place.
Our analysis shows that the effects reported in recent literature must be
substantially revised: (i) the proposed negative correlation between meaning
change and word frequency is shown to be largely an artefact of the models of
word representation used; (ii) the proposed negative correlation between
meaning change and prototypicality is shown to be much weaker than what has
been claimed in prior art; and (iii) the proposed positive correlation between
meaning change and polysemy is largely an artefact of word frequency. These
empirical observations are corroborated by analytical proofs that show that
count representations introduce an inherent dependence on word frequency, and
thus word frequency cannot be evaluated as an independent factor with these
representations.
