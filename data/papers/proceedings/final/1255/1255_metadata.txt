Abstract#==#Natural language constitutes a predominant medium for much of human learning
and pedagogy. We consider the problem of concept learning from natural language
explanations, and a small number of labeled examples of the concept. For
example, in learning the concept of a phishing email, one might say `this is a
phishing email because it asks for your bank account number'. Solving this
problem involves both learning to interpret open ended natural language
statements, and learning the concept itself. We present a joint model for (1)
language interpretation (semantic parsing) and (2) concept learning
(classification) that does not require labeling statements with logical forms.
Instead, the model prefers discriminative interpretations of statements in
context of observable features of the data as a weak signal for parsing. On a
dataset of email-related concepts, our approach yields across-the-board
improvements in classification performance, with a 30% relative improvement in
F1 score over competitive methods in the low data regime.
