Abstract#==#Word embeddings seek to recover a Euclidean metric space by mapping words into
vectors, starting from words co-occurrences in a corpus. Word embeddings may
underestimate the similarity between nearby words, and overestimate it between
distant words in the Euclidean metric space. In this paper, we re-embed
pre-trained word embeddings with a stage of manifold learning which retains
dimensionality. We show that this approach is
theoretically founded in the metric recovery paradigm, and empirically show
that it can improve on state-of-the-art embeddings in word similarity tasks 0.5
- 5.0% points depending on the original space.
