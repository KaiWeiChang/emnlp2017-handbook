Abstract#==#Distantly supervised relation extraction has been widely used to find novel
relational facts from plain text. To predict the relation between a pair of two
target entities, existing methods solely rely on those direct sentences
containing both entities. In fact, there are also many sentences containing
only one of the target entities, which also provide rich useful information but
not yet employed by relation extraction. To address this issue, we build
inference chains between two target entities via intermediate entities, and
propose a path-based neural relation extraction model to encode the relational
semantics from both direct sentences and inference chains. Experimental results
on real-world datasets show that, our model can make full use of those
sentences containing only one target entity, and achieves significant and
consistent improvements on relation extraction as compared with strong
baselines. The source code of this paper can be obtained from https://
