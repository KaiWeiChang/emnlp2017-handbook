Abstract#==#We propose a novel framework based on neural networks to identify the sentiment
of opinion targets in a comment/review. Our framework adopts multiple-attention
mechanism to capture sentiment features separated by a long distance, so that
it is more robust against irrelevant information. The results of multiple
attentions are non-linearly combined with a recurrent neural network, which
strengthens the expressive power of our model for handling more complications.
The weighted-memory mechanism not only helps us avoid the labor-intensive
feature engineering work, but also provides a tailor-made memory for different
opinion targets of a sentence. We examine the merit of our model on four
datasets: two are from SemEval2014, i.e. reviews of restaurants and laptops; a
twitter dataset, for testing its performance on social media data; and a
Chinese news comment dataset, for testing its language sensitivity. The
experimental results show that our model consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on different types of data.
