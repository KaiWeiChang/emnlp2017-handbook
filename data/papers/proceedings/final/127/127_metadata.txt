Abstract#==#The generation of complex derived word forms has been an overlooked problem in
NLP; we fill this gap by applying neural sequence-to-sequence models to the
task. We overview the theoretical motivation for a paradigmatic treatment of
derivational morphology, and introduce the task of derivational paradigm
completion as a parallel to inflectional paradigm completion. State-of-the-art
neural models adapted from the inflection task are able to learn the range of
derivation patterns, and outperform a non-neural baseline by 16.4%. However,
due to semantic, historical, and lexical considerations involved in
derivational morphology, future work will be needed to achieve performance
parity with inflection-generating systems.
