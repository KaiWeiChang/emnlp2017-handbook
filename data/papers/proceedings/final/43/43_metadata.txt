Abstract#==#Traditionally, word segmentation (WS) adopts the single-grained formalism,
where a sentence corresponds to a single word sequence. However, Sproat et al.
(1997) show that the inter-native-speaker consistency ratio over Chinese word
boundaries is only 76\%, indicating single-grained WS (SWS) imposes unnecessary
challenges on both manual annotation and statistical modeling.
Moreover, WS results of different granularities can be complementary and
beneficial for high-level applications. 

This work proposes and addresses multi-grained WS (MWS). We build a large-scale
pseudo MWS dataset for model training and tuning by leveraging the annotation
heterogeneity of 
three SWS datasets.
Then we manually annotate 1,500 test sentences with true MWS annotations. 
Finally, we propose three benchmark approaches by casting MWS as constituent
parsing and sequence
labeling. 
Experiments and analysis lead to many interesting findings.
