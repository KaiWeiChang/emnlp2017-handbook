Abstract#==#In the encoder-decoder architecture for neural machine translation (NMT), the
hidden states of the recurrent structures in the encoder and decoder carry the
crucial information about the sentence. These vectors are generated by
parameters which are updated by back-propagation of translation errors through
time.We argue that propagating errors through the end-to-end recurrent
structures are not a direct way of control the hidden vectors. 
In this paper, we propose to use word predictions as a mechanism for direct
supervision. More specifically, we require these vectors to be able to predict
the vocabulary in target sentence. Our simple mechanism ensures better
representations in the encoder and decoder without using any extra data or
annotation. It is also helpful in reducing the target side vocabulary and
improving the decoding efficiency. Experiments on Chinese-English machine
translation task show an average BLEU improvement by 4.53, respectively.
