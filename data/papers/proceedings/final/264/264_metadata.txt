Abstract#==#In this work, we study the problem of part-of-speech tagging for Tweets. In
contrast to newswire articles, Tweets are usually informal and contain numerous
out-of-vocabulary words. Moreover, there is a lack of large scale labeled
datasets for this domain. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel neural
network to make use of out-of-domain labeled data, unlabeled in-domain data,
and labeled in-domain data.  Inspired by adversarial neural networks, the
proposed method tries to learn common features through adversarial
discriminator. In addition, we hypothesize that domain-specific features of
target domain should be preserved in some degree. Hence, the proposed method
adopts a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder to perform this task.  Experimental
results on three different datasets  show that our method achieves better
performance than state-of-the-art methods.
