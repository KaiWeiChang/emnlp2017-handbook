Abstract#==#Previous work on dialog act (DA) classification has investigated different
methods, such as hidden Markov models, maximum entropy, conditional random
fields, graphical models, and support vector machines.
A few recent studies explored using deep learning neural networks for DA
classification, however, it is not clear yet what is the best method for using
dialog context or DA sequential information, and how much gain it brings. This
paper proposes several ways of using context information for DA classification,
all in the deep learning framework. The baseline system classifies each
utterance using the convolutional neural networks (CNN). Our proposed methods
include using hierarchical models (recurrent neural networks (RNN) or CNN) for
DA sequence tagging where the bottom layer takes the sentence CNN
representation as input, concatenating predictions from the previous utterances
with the CNN vector for classification, and performing sequence decoding based
on the predictions from the sentence CNN model. 
We conduct thorough experiments and comparisons on the Switchboard corpus,
demonstrate that incorporating context information significantly improves DA
classification, and show that we achieve new state-of-the-art performance for
this task.
