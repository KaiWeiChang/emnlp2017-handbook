Abstract#==#A document outlier is a document that substantially deviates in semantics from
the majority ones in a corpus.              Automatic identification of document
outliers
can be valuable in many applications, such as screening health records for
medical mistakes.  In this paper, we study the problem of mining semantically
deviating document outliers in a given corpus.              We develop a generative
model
to identify frequent and characteristic semantic regions in the word embedding
space to represent the given corpus, and a robust outlierness measure which is
resistant to noisy content in documents.  Experiments conducted on two
real-world textual data sets show that our method can achieve an up to 135%
improvement over baselines in terms of recall at top-1% of the outlier ranking.
