Abstract#==#This paper addresses the automatic recognition of telicity, an aspectual
notion. A telic event includes a natural endpoint ("she walked home"), while an
atelic event does not ("she walked around"). Recognizing this difference is a
prerequisite for temporal natural language understanding. In English, this
classification task is difficult, as telicity is a covert linguistic category.
In contrast, in Slavic languages, aspect is part of a verb's meaning and even
available in machine-readable dictionaries. Our contributions are as follows.
We successfully leverage additional silver standard training data in the form
of projected annotations from parallel English-Czech data as well as context
information, improving automatic telicity classification for English
significantly compared to previous work. We also create a new data set of
English texts manually annotated with telicity.
