Abstract#==#This paper presents a deep neural solver to automatically solve math word
problems. In contrast to previous statistical learning approaches, we directly
translate math word problems to equation templates using a recurrent neural
network (RNN) model, without sophisticated feature engineering. We further
design a hybrid model that combines the RNN model and a similarity-based
retrieval model to achieve additional performance improvement. Experiments
conducted on a large dataset show that the RNN model and the hybrid model
significantly outperform state-of-the-art statistical learning methods for math
word problem solving.
