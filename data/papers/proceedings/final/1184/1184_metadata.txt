Abstract#==#Explaining underlying causes or effects about events is a challenging but
valuable task.
We define a novel problem of generating explanations of a time series event by
(1) searching cause and effect relationships of the time series with textual
data and (2) constructing a connecting chain between them to generate an
explanation.
To detect causal features from text, we propose a novel method based on the
Granger causality of time series between features extracted from text such as
N-grams, topics, sentiments, and their composition.
The generation of the sequence of causal entities requires a commonsense
causative knowledge base with efficient reasoning. 
To ensure good interpretability and appropriate lexical usage we combine
symbolic and neural representations, using a neural reasoning algorithm trained
on commonsense causal tuples to predict the next cause step.
Our quantitative and human analysis show empirical evidence that our method
successfully extracts meaningful causality relationships between time series
with textual features and generates appropriate explanation between them.
