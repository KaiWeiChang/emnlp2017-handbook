Abstract#==#Textbooks are rich sources of information. Harvesting structured knowledge from
textbooks is a key challenge in many educational applications. As a case study,
we present an approach for harvesting structured axiomatic knowledge from math
textbooks. Our approach uses rich contextual and typographical features
extracted from raw textbooks. It leverages the redundancy and shared ordering
across multiple textbooks to further refine the harvested axioms. These axioms
are then parsed into rules that are used to improve the state-of-the-art in
solving geometry problems.
