Abstract#==#Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in NLP tasks. This paper
presents a novel weight initialization method to improve the CNNs for text
classification. Instead of randomly initializing the convolutional filters, we
encode semantic features into them, which helps the model focus on learning
useful features at the beginning of the training. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the initialization technique on seven text classification
tasks, including sentiment analysis and topic classification.
