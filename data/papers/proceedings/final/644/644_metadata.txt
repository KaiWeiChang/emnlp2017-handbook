Abstract#==#In this paper we propose a model to
learn multimodal multilingual representations
for matching images and sentences
in different languages, with the aim of
advancing multilingual versions of image
search and image understanding. Our
model learns a common representation for
images and their descriptions in two different
languages (which need not be parallel)
by considering the image as a pivot between
two languages. We introduce a new
pairwise ranking loss function which can
handle both symmetric and asymmetric
similarity between the two modalities. We
evaluate our models on image-description
ranking for German and English, and on
semantic textual similarity of image descriptions
in English. In both cases we
achieve state-of-the-art performance.
