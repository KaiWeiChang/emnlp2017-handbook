Abstract#==#This paper presents a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to model single-turn
short-text conversations, which trains a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) network
for response generation simultaneously with a discriminative classifier that
measures the differences between human-produced responses and machine-generated
ones. In addition, the proposed method introduces an approximate embedding
layer to solve the non-differentiable problem caused by the sampling-based
output decoding procedure in the Seq2Seq generative model. The GAN setup
provides an effective way to avoid noninformative responses (a.k.a “safe
responses”), which are frequently observed in traditional neural response
generators.
The experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly
outperforms existing neural response generation models in diversity metrics,
with slight increases in relevance scores as well, when evaluated on both a
Mandarin corpus and an English corpus.
