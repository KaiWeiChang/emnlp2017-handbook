Abstract#==#The computational complexity of linear-chain Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)
makes it difficult to deal with very large label sets and long range
dependencies. Such situations are not rare and arise when dealing with
morphologically rich languages or joint labelling tasks. We extend here recent
proposals to consider variable order CRFs. Using an effective finite-state
representation of variable-length dependencies, we propose new ways to perform
feature selection at large scale and report experimental results where we
outperform strong baselines on a tagging task.
