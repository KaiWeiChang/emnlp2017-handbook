Abstract#==#We propose a novel LSTM-based deep multi-task learning framework for aspect
term extraction from user review sentences. Two LSTMs equipped with extended
memories and neural memory operations are designed for jointly handling the
extraction tasks of aspects and opinions via memory interactions. Sentimental
sentence constraint is also added for more accurate prediction via another
LSTM. Experiment results over two benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework.
