Abstract#==#Verifiability is one of the core editing principles in Wikipedia, where editors
are encouraged to provide  citations for the added content. For a Wikipedia
article determining what content is covered by a citation or the citation span
is not trivial, an important aspect for automated citation finding for
uncovered content, or fact assessments.

We address the problem of determining the citation span in Wikipedia articles.
We approach this problem by classifying which textual fragments in an article
are covered or hold true given a citation. We propose a sequence classification
approach where for a paragraph and a citation, we determine the citation span
at a fine-grained
level.

We provide a thorough experimental evaluation and compare our approach against
baselines adopted from the scientific domain, where we show improvement for all
evaluation metrics.
