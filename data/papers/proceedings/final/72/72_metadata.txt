Abstract#==#Community-driven Question Answering (CQA) systems such as Yahoo! Answers have
become valuable sources of reusable information. CQA retrieval enables usage of
historical CQA archives to solve new questions posed by users. This task has
received much recent attention, with methods building upon literature from
translation models, topic models, and deep learning. In this paper, we devise a
CQA retrieval technique, LASER-QA, that embeds question-answer pairs within a
unified latent space preserving the local neighborhood structure of question
and answer spaces. The idea is that such a space mirrors semantic similarity
among questions as well as answers, thereby enabling high quality retrieval.
Through an empirical analysis on various real-world QA datasets, we illustrate
the improved effectiveness of LASER-QA over state-of-the-art methods.
