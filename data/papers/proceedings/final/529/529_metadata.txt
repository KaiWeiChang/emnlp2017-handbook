Abstract#==#One weakness of machine-learned NLP models is that they typically perform
poorly on out-of-domain data. In this work, we study the task of identifying
products being bought and sold in online cybercrime forums, which exhibits
particularly challenging cross-domain effects. We formulate a task that
represents a hybrid of slot-filling information extraction and named entity
recognition and annotate data from four different forums. Each of these forums
constitutes its own "fine-grained domain" in that the forums cover different
market sectors with different properties, even though all forums are in the
broad domain of cybercrime. We characterize these domain differences in the
context of a learning-based system: supervised models see decreased accuracy
when applied to new forums, and standard techniques for semi-supervised
learning and domain adaptation have limited effectiveness on this data, which
suggests the need to improve these techniques. We release a dataset of 1,938
annotated posts from across the four forums.
