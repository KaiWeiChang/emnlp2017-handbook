Abstract#==#Humans interpret texts with respect to some background information, or world
knowledge, and we would like to develop automatic reading comprehension systems
that can do the same. In this paper, we introduce a task and several models to
drive progress towards this goal. In particular, we propose the task of rare
entity prediction: given a web document with several entities removed, models
are tasked with predicting the correct missing entities conditioned on the
document context and the lexical resources. This task is challenging due to the
diversity of language styles and the extremely large number of rare entities.
We propose two recurrent neural network architectures which make use of
external knowledge in the form of entity descriptions. Our experiments show
that our hierarchical LSTM model performs significantly better at the rare
entity prediction task than those that do not make use of external resources.
