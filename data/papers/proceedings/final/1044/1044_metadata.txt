Abstract#==#We propose a novel deep learning model for joint document-level entity
disambiguation, which leverages learned neural representations. Key components
are entity embeddings, a neural attention mechanism over local context windows,
and a differentiable joint inference stage for disambiguation. Our approach
thereby combines benefits of deep learning with more traditional approaches
such as graphical models and probabilistic mention-entity maps. Extensive
experiments show that we are able to obtain competitive or state-of-the-art
accuracy at moderate computational costs.
