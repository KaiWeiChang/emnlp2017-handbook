Abstract#==#We present a simple and effective approach to incorporating syntactic structure
into neural attention-based encoder-decoder models for machine translation. We
rely on graph-convolutional networks (GCNs), a recent class of neural networks
developed for modeling graph-structured data. Our GCNs use predicted syntactic
dependency trees of source sentences to produce representations of words (i.e.
hidden states of the encoder) that are sensitive to their syntactic
neighborhoods. GCNs take word representations as input and produce word
representations as output, so they can easily be incorporated as layers into
standard encoders (e.g., on top of bidirectional RNNs or convolutional neural
networks). We evaluate their effectiveness with English-German and
English-Czech translation experiments for different types of encoders and
observe substantial improvements over their syntax-agnostic versions in all the
considered setups.
