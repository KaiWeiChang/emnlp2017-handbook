Abstract#==#Sentence pair modeling is a crucial problem in the field of natural language
processing. 
In this paper, we propose a model to measure the similarity of a sentence pair
focusing on the interaction information. We utilize the word level similarity
matrix to discover fine-grained alignment of two sentences. It should be
emphasized that each word in a sentence has a different importance from the
perspective of semantic composition, so we exploit two novel and efficient
strategies to explicitly calculate a weight for each word. Although the
proposed model only use a sequential LSTM for sentence modeling without any
external resource such as syntactic parser tree and additional lexicon
features, experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on three datasets of two tasks.
