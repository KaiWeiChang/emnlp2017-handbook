Abstract#==#Existing approaches for Chinese zero pronoun resolution typically utilize only
syntactical and lexical features while ignoring semantic information. The
fundamental reason is that zero pronouns have no descriptive information, which
brings difficulty in explicitly capturing their semantic similarities with
antecedents. Meanwhile, representing zero pronouns is challenging since they
are merely gaps that convey no actual content. In this paper, we address this
issue by building a deep memory network that is capable of encoding zero
pronouns into vector representations with information obtained from their
contexts and potential antecedents. Consequently, our resolver takes advantage
of semantic information by using these continuous distributed representations.
Experiments on the OntoNotes 5.0 dataset show that the proposed memory network
could substantially outperform the state-of-the-art systems in various
experimental settings.
