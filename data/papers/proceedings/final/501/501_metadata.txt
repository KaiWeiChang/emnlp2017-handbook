Abstract#==#Recommendations are often rated for their subjective quality, but few
researchers have studied comment quality in terms of objective utility. We
explore
recommendation quality assessment with respect to both subjective (i.e.
usersâ€™ ratings) and
objective (i.e., did it influence? did it improve decisions?) metrics in a
massive online geopolitical forecasting system, ultimately comparing linguistic
characteristics of each quality metric. Using a variety of features, we predict
all types of quality with better accuracy than the simple yet strong baseline
of comment length. Looking at the most predictive content illustrates rater
biases; for example, forecasters are subjectively biased in favor of comments
mentioning business transactions or dealings as well as material things, even
though such comments do not indeed prove any more useful objectively.
Additionally, more complex sentence constructions, as evidenced by subordinate
conjunctions, are characteristic of comments leading to objective improvements
in forecasting.
