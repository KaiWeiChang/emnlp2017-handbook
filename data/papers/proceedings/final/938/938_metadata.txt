Abstract#==#We propose a general class of language models that treat reference as discrete
stochastic latent variables. This decision allows for the creation of entity
mentions by accessing external databases of referents (required by, e.g.,
dialogue generation) or past internal state (required to explicitly model
coreferentiality). Beyond simple copying, our coreference model can
additionally refer to a referent using varied mention forms (e.g., a reference
to “Jane” can be realized as “she”), a characteristic feature of
reference in natural languages. Experiments on three representative
applications show our model variants outperform models based on deterministic
attention and standard language modeling baselines.
