Abstract#==#Recent efforts in bioinformatics have achieved tremendous progress in the ma-
chine reading of biomedical literature, and the assembly of the extracted
biochem- ical interactions into large-scale models such as protein signaling
pathways. How- ever, batch machine reading of literature at today’s scale
(PubMed alone indexes over 1 million papers per year) is unfea- sible due to
both cost and processing over- head. In this work, we introduce a focused
reading approach to guide the machine reading of biomedical literature towards
what literature should be read to answer a biomedical query as efficiently as
pos- sible. We introduce a family of algorithms for focused reading, including
an intuitive, strong baseline, and a second approach which uses a reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that learns when to explore (widen the search) or
exploit (narrow it). We demonstrate that the RL approach is capable of
answering more queries than the baseline, while being more efficient, i.e.,
reading fewer documents.
