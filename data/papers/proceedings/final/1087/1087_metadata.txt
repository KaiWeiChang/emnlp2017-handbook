Abstract#==#We introduce a new method for frame-semantic parsing that significantly
improves the prior state of the art. Our model leverages the advantages of a
deep bidirectional LSTM network which predicts semantic role labels word by
word and a relational network which predicts semantic roles for individual text
expressions in relation to a predicate. The two networks are integrated into a
single model via knowledge distillation, and a unified graphical model is
employed to jointly decode frames and semantic roles during inference.
Experiments on the standard FrameNet data show that our model significantly
outperforms existing neural and non-neural approaches, achieving a 5.7 F1 gain
over the current state of the art, for full frame structure extraction.
