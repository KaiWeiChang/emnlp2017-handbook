Abstract#==#We focus on non-standard usages of common words on social media. In the context
of social media, words sometimes have other usages that are totally different
from their original. In this study, we attempt to distinguish non-standard
usages on social media from standard ones in an unsupervised manner. Our basic
idea is that non-standardness can be measured by the inconsistency between the
expected meaning of the target word and the given context. For this purpose, we
use context embeddings derived from word embeddings. Our experimental results
show that the model leveraging the context embedding outperforms other methods
and provide us with findings, for example, on how to construct context
embeddings and which corpus to use.
