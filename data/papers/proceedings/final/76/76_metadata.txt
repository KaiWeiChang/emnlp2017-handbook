Abstract#==#GRASP (GReedy Augmented Sequential Patterns) is an algorithm for automatically
extracting patterns that characterize subtle linguistic phenomena. To that end,
GRASP augments each term of input text with multiple layers of linguistic
information. These different facets of the text terms are systematically
combined to reveal rich patterns. We report highly promising experimental
results in several challenging text analysis tasks within the field of
Argumentation Mining. We believe that GRASP is general enough to be useful for
other domains too.

For example, each of the following sentences includes a claim for a [topic]:
1. Opponents often argue that the open primary is unconstitutional. [Open
Primaries]
2. Prof. Smith suggested that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments
of the chosen. [Affirmative Action]
3. The majority stated that the First Amendment does not guarantee the right to
offend others. [Freedom of Speech]

These sentences share almost no words in common, however, they are similar at a
more abstract level. A human observer may notice the following underlying
common structure, or pattern: [someone][argue/suggest/state][that][topic
term][sentiment term].

GRASP aims to automatically capture such underlying structures of the given
data. For the above examples it finds the pattern
[noun][express][that][noun,topic][sentiment], where [express] stands for all
its (in)direct hyponyms, and [noun,topic] means a noun which is also related to
the topic.
