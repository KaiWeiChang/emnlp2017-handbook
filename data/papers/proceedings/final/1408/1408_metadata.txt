Abstract#==#In this paper, we utilize the linguistic structures of texts to improve named
entity recognition by BRNN-CNN, a special bidirectional recursive network
attached with a convolutional network. Motivated by the observation that named
entities are highly related to linguistic constituents, we propose a
constituent-based BRNN-CNN for named entity recognition. In contrast to
classical sequential labeling methods, the system first identifies which text
chunks are possible named entities by whether they are linguistic constituents.
Then it classifies these chunks with a constituency tree structure by
recursively propagating syntactic and semantic information to each constituent
node. This method surpasses current state-of-the-art on OntoNotes 5.0 with
automatically generated parses.
