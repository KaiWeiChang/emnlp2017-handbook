Abstract#==#Topic segmentation plays an important role for discourse parsing and
information retrieval. Due to the absence of training data, previous work
mainly adopts unsupervised methods to rank semantic coherence between
paragraphs for topic segmentation. In this paper, we present an intuitive and
simple idea to automatically create a "quasi" training dataset, which includes
a large amount of text pairs from the same or different documents with
different semantic coherence. With the training corpus, we design a symmetric
CNN neural network to model text pairs and rank the semantic coherence within
the learning to rank framework. Experiments show that our algorithm is able to
achieve competitive performance over strong baselines on several real-world
datasets.
