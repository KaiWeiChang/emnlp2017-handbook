Abstract#==#This paper presents a novel hybrid generative/discriminative model of word
segmentation based on nonparametric Bayesian methods. Unlike ordinary
discriminative word segmentation which relies only on labeled data, our
semi-supervised model also leverages a huge amount of unlabeled text to
automatically learn new "words'', and further constrains them by using a
labeled data to segment non-standard texts such as those found in social
networking services. Specifically, our hybrid model combines a discriminative
classifier (CRF; Lafferty et al. (2001)) and unsupervised word segmentation
(NPYLM; Mochihashi et al. (2009)) with a transparent exchange of information
between these two model structures within the semi-supervised framework
(JESS-CM; Suzuki et al. (2008)). We confirmed that it can appropriately segment
non-standard texts like those in Twitter and Weibo and has nearly
state-of-the-art accuracy on standard datasets in Japanese, Chinese, and Thai.
