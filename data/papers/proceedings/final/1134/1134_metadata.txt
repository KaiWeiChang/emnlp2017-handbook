Abstract#==#Given a question and a set of answer candidates, answer triggering determines
whether the candidate set contains any correct answers. If yes, it then outputs
a correct one. In contrast to existing pipeline methods which first consider
individual candidate answers separately and then make a prediction based on a
threshold, we propose an end-to-end deep neural network framework, which is
trained by a novel group-level objective function that directly optimizes the
answer triggering performance. Our objective function penalizes three potential
types of error and allows training the framework in an end-to-end manner.
Experimental results on the WikiQA benchmark show that our framework
outperforms the state of the arts by a 6.6% absolute gain under F1 measure.
