Abstract#==#Idioms are peculiar linguistic constructions that impose great challenges for
representing the semantics of language, especially in current prevailing
end-to-end neural models, which assume that the semantics of a phrase or
sentence can be literally composed from its constitutive words.
In this paper, we propose an idiom-aware distributed semantic model to build
representation of sentences on the basis of understanding their contained
idioms. Our models are grounded in the literal-first psycholinguistic
hypothesis, which can adaptively learn semantic compositionality of a phrase
literally or idiomatically. To better evaluate our models, we also construct an
idiom-enriched sentiment classification dataset with considerable scale and
abundant peculiarities of idioms. The qualitative and quantitative experimental
analyses demonstrate the efficacy of our models.
