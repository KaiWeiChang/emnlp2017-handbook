Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose a new pipeline of word embedding for unsegmented
languages, called segmentation-free word embedding, which does not require word
segmentation as a preprocessing step. Unlike space-delimited languages,
unsegmented languages, such as Chinese and Japanese, require word segmentation
as a preprocessing step. However, word segmentation, that often requires
manually annotated resources, is difficult and expensive, and unavoidable
errors in word segmentation affect downstream tasks. To avoid these problems in
learning word vectors of unsegmented languages, we consider word co-occurrence
statistics over all possible candidates of segmentations based on frequent
character n-grams instead of segmented sentences provided by conventional word
segmenters. Our experiments of noun category prediction tasks on raw Twitter,
Weibo, and Wikipedia corpora show that the proposed method outperforms the
conventional approaches that require word segmenters.
