  abstract  = {Identifying temporal relations between events is an essential step towards
	natural language understanding. However, the temporal relation between two
	events in a story depends on, and is often dictated by, relations among other
	events. Consequently, effectively identifying temporal relations between events
	is a challenging problem even for human annotators. This paper suggests that it
	is important to take these dependencies into account while learning to identify
	these relations and proposes a structured learning approach to address this
	challenge. As a byproduct, this provides a new perspective on handling missing
	relations, a known issue that hurts existing methods. As we show, the proposed
	approach results in significant improvements on the two commonly used data sets
	for this problem.},
