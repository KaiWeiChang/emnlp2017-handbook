  abstract  = {For the task of relation extraction, distant supervision is an efficient
	approach to generate labeled data by aligning knowledge base with free texts.
	The essence of it is a challenging incomplete multi-label classification
	problem with sparse and noisy features. To address the challenge, this work
	presents a novel nonparametric Bayesian formulation for the task. Experiment
	results show substantially higher top precision improvements over the
	traditional state-of-the-art approaches.},
