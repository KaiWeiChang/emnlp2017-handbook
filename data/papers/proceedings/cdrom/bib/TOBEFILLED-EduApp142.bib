  abstract  = {This paper presents an analysis of argumentation strategies in news editorials
	within and across topics. Given nearly 29,000 argumentative editorials from the
	New York Times, we develop two machine learning models, one for determining an
	editorial's topic, and one for identifying evidence types in the editorial.
	Based on the distribution and structure of the identified types, we analyze the
	usage patterns of argumentation strategies among 12 different topics. We detect
	several common patterns that provide insights into the manifestation of
	argumentation strategies. Also, our experiments reveal clear correlations
	between the topics and the detected patterns.},
