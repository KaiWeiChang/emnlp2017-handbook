  abstract  = {Word Sense Disambiguation models exist in many flavors. Even though supervised
	ones tend to perform best in terms of accuracy, they often lose ground to more
	flexible knowledge-based solutions, which do not require training by a word
	expert for every disambiguation target. To bridge this gap we adopt a different
	perspective and rely on sequence learning to frame the disambiguation problem:
	we propose and study in depth a series of end-to-end neural architectures
	directly tailored to the task, from bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory to
	encoder-decoder models. Our extensive evaluation over standard benchmarks and
	in multiple languages shows that sequence learning enables more versatile
	all-words models that consistently lead to state-of-the-art results, even
	against word experts with engineered features.},
