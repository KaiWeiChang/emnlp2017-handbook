  abstract  = {Source dependency information has been successfully introduced into statistical
	machine translation. However, there are only a few preliminary attempts for
	Neural Machine Translation (NMT), such as concatenating representations of
	source word and its dependency label together. In this paper, we propose a
	novel NMT with source dependency representation to improve translation
	performance of NMT, especially long sentences. Empirical results on NIST
	Chinese-to-English translation task show that our method achieves 1.6 BLEU
	improvements on average over a strong NMT system.},
