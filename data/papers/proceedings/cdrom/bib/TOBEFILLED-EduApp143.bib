  abstract  = {We study the helpful product reviews identification problem in this paper. We
	observe that the evidence-conclusion discourse relations, also known as
	arguments, often appear in product reviews, and we hypothesise that some
	argument-based features, e.g. the percentage of argumentative sentences, the
	evidences-conclusions ratios, are good indicators of helpful reviews. To
	validate this hypothesis, we manually annotate arguments in 110 hotel reviews,
	and investigate the effectiveness of several combinations of argument-based
	features. Experiments suggest that, when being used together with the
	argument-based features, the state-of-the-art baseline features can enjoy a
	performance boost (in terms of F1) of 11.01\% in average.},
