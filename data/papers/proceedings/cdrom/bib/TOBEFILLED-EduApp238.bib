  abstract  = {n this paper, we present a set of computational methods to identify the
	likeliness of a word being borrowed, based on the signals from social media. In
	terms of Spearman’s correlation values, our methods perform more than two
	times better (∼ 0.62) in predicting the borrowing likeliness compared to the
	best performing baseline (∼ 0.26) reported in literature. Based on this
	likeliness estimate we asked annotators to re-annotate the language tags of
	foreign words in predominantly native contexts. In 88% of cases the annotators
	felt that the foreign language tag should be replaced by native language tag,
	thus indicating a huge scope for improvement of automatic language
	identification systems.},
