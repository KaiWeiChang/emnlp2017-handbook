  abstract  = {The framing of an action influences how we perceive its actor. We introduce
	connotation frames of power and agency, a pragmatic formalism organized using
	frame semantic representations, to model how different levels of power and
	agency are implicitly projected on actors through their actions. We use the new
	power and agency frames to measure the subtle, but prevalent, gender bias in
	the portrayal of modern film characters and provide insights that deviate from
	the well-known Bechdel test. Our contributions include an extended lexicon of
	connotation frames along with a web interface that provides a comprehensive
	analysis through the lens of connotation frames.},
