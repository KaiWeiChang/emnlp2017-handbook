  abstract  = {Crowdsourcing offers a convenient means of obtaining labeled data quickly and
	inexpensively.              However, crowdsourced labels are often noisier than
	expert-annotated data, making it difficult to aggregate them meaningfully.  We
	present an aggregation approach that learns a regression model from
	crowdsourced annotations to predict aggregated labels for instances that have
	no expert adjudications.  The predicted labels achieve a correlation of 0.594
	with expert labels on our data, outperforming the best alternative aggregation
	method by 11.9%.  Our approach also outperforms the alternatives on third-party
	datasets.},
