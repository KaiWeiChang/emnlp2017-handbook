  abstract  = {We propose a deep learning architecture to capture argumentative relations of
	attack and support from one piece of text to another, of the kind that
	naturally occur in a debate. The architecture uses two (unidirectional or
	bidirectional) Long Short-Term Memory networks and (trained or non-trained)
	word embeddings, and allows to considerably improve upon existing techniques
	that use syntactic features and supervised classifiers for the same form of
	(relation-based) argument mining.},
