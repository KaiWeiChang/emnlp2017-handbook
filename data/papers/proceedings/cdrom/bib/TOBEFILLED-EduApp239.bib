  abstract  = {In this paper, we demonstrate how the state-of-the-art machine learning and
	text mining techniques can be used to build effective social media-based
	substance use detection systems.  Since a substance use ground truth is
	difficult to obtain on a large scale, to maximize system performance, we
	explore different unsupervised feature learning methods to take advantage of a
	large amount of unsupervised social media data. We also demonstrate the benefit
	of using multi-view unsupervised feature learning to combine heterogeneous user
	information such as Facebook "likes" and  "status updates"  to enhance system
	performance.  Based on our evaluation, our best models achieved 86% AUC for
	predicting tobacco use,  81% for alcohol use and 84% for illicit drug use, all
	of which significantly outperformed existing methods. Our investigation has
	also uncovered interesting relations between a user's social media behavior
	(e.g., word usage) and substance use.},
