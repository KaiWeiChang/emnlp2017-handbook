  abstract  = {In this paper, we address the problem of predicting one of three functions for
	the English pronoun `it': anaphoric, event reference or pleonastic. This
	disambiguation is valuable in the context of machine translation and
	coreference resolution. We present experiments using a MAXENT classifier
	trained on gold-standard data and self-training experiments of an RNN trained
	on silver-standard data, annotated using the MAXENT classifier. Lastly, we
	report on an analysis of the strengths of these two models.},
