  abstract  = {We present a new method for the joint task of tagging and non-projective
	dependency parsing. We demonstrate its usefulness with an application to
	discontinuous phrase-structure parsing where decoding lexicalized spines and
	syntactic derivations is performed jointly. The main contributions of this
	paper are (1) a reduction from joint tagging and non-projective dependency
	parsing to the Generalized Maximum Spanning Arborescence problem, and (2) a
	novel decoding algorithm for this problem through Lagrangian relaxation. We
	evaluate this model and obtain state-of-the-art results despite strong
	independence assumptions.},
