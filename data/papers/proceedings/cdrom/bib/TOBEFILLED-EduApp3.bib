  abstract  = {We propose a new Maximum Subgraph algorithm for first-order parsing to
	1-endpoint-crossing, pagenumber-2 graphs. Our algorithm has two
	characteristics: (1) it separates the construction for noncrossing edges and
	crossing edges; (2) in a single construction step, whether to create a new arc
	is deterministic. These two characteristics make our algorithm relatively easy
	to be extended to incorporiate crossing-sensitive second-order features. We
	then introduce a new algorithm for quasi-second-order parsing. Experiments
	demonstrate that second-order features are helpful for Maximum Subgraph
	parsing.},
