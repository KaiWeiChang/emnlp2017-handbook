  abstract  = {In order to adopt deep learning for information retrieval, models are needed
	that can capture all relevant information required to assess the relevance of a
	document to a given
	user query. While previous works have successfully captured unigram term
	matches, how to fully employ position-dependent information such as proximity
	and term dependencies has been insufficiently explored. In this work, we
	propose a novel neural IR model named PACRR
	aiming at better modeling position-dependent interactions between a query and a
	document.
	Extensive experiments on six years' TREC Web Track data confirm that the
	proposed model yields better results under multiple benchmarks.},
