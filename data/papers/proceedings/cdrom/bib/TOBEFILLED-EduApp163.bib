  abstract  = {We propose a new, socially-impactful task for natural language processing: from
	a news corpus, extract names of persons who have been killed by police. We
	present a newly collected police fatality corpus, which we release publicly,
	and present a model to solve this problem that uses EM-based distant
	supervision with logistic regression and convolutional neural network
	classifiers. Our model outperforms two off-the-shelf event extractor systems,
	and it can suggest candidate victim names in some cases faster than one of the
	major manually-collected police fatality databases.},
