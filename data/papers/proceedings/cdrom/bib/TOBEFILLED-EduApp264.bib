  abstract  = {We present a method for translating texts between close language pairs.  The
	method does not require parallel data, and it does not require the languages to
	be written in the same script.              We show results for six language pairs:
	Afrikaans/Dutch, Bosnian/Serbian, Danish/Swedish, Macedonian/Bulgarian,
	Malaysian/Indonesian, and Polish/Belorussian.  We report BLEU scores showing
	our method to outperform others that do not use parallel data.},
