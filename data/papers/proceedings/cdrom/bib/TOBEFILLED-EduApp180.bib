  abstract  = {We present supertagging-based models for Tree Adjoining Grammar parsing that
	use neural network architectures and dense vector representation of supertags
	(elementary trees) to achieve state-of-the-art performance in unlabeled and
	labeled attachment scores. The shift-reduce parsing model eschews lexical
	information entirely, and uses only the 1-best supertags to parse a sentence,
	providing further support for the claim that supertagging is "almost parsing."
	We demonstrate that the embedding vector representations the parser induces for
	supertags possess linguistically interpretable structure, supporting analogies
	between grammatical structures like those familiar from recent work in
	distributional semantics. This dense representation of supertags overcomes the
	drawbacks for statistical models of TAG as compared to CCG parsing, raising the
	possibility that TAG is a viable alternative for NLP tasks that require the
	assignment of richer structural descriptions to sentences.},
