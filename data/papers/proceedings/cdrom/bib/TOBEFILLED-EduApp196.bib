  abstract  = {This paper presents a new approach for building Language Models using the
	Quantum Probability Theory, a Quantum Language Model (QLM). It mainly shows
	that relying on this probability calculus it is possible to build stochastic
	models able to benefit from quantum correlations due to interference and
	entanglement. We extensively tested our approach showing its superior
	performances, both in terms of model perplexity and inserting it into an
	automatic speech recognition evaluation setting, when compared with
	state-of-the-art language modelling techniques.},
