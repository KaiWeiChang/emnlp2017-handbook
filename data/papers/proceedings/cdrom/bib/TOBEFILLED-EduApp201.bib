  abstract  = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in NLP tasks. This paper
	presents a novel weight initialization method to improve the CNNs for text
	classification. Instead of randomly initializing the convolutional filters, we
	encode semantic features into them, which helps the model focus on learning
	useful features at the beginning of the training. Experiments demonstrate the
	effectiveness of the initialization technique on seven text classification
	tasks, including sentiment analysis and topic classification.},
