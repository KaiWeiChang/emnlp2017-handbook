  abstract  = {In this paper we investigate a new task of automatically constructing an
	overview article from a given set of news articles about a news event.
	We propose a news synthesis approach to address this task based on passage
	segmentation, ranking, selection and merging.
	Our proposed approach is compared with several typical multi-document
	summarization methods on the Wikinews dataset, and achieves the best
	performance on both automatic evaluation and manual evaluation.},
