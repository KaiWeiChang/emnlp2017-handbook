  abstract  = {Given a question and a set of answer candidates, answer triggering determines
	whether the candidate set contains any correct answers. If yes, it then outputs
	a correct one. In contrast to existing pipeline methods which first consider
	individual candidate answers separately and then make a prediction based on a
	threshold, we propose an end-to-end deep neural network framework, which is
	trained by a novel group-level objective function that directly optimizes the
	answer triggering performance. Our objective function penalizes three potential
	types of error and allows training the framework in an end-to-end manner.
	Experimental results on the WikiQA benchmark show that our framework
	outperforms the state of the arts by a 6.6% absolute gain under F1 measure.},
