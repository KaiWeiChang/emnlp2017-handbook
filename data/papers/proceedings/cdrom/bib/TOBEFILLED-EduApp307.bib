  abstract  = {We show that small and shallow feed-forward neural networks can achieve near
	state-of-the-art results on a range of unstructured and structured language
	processing tasks while being considerably cheaper in memory and computational
	requirements than deep recurrent models.
	Motivated by resource-constrained environments like mobile phones, we showcase
	simple techniques for obtaining such small neural network models, and
	investigate different tradeoffs when deciding how to allocate a small memory
	budget.},
