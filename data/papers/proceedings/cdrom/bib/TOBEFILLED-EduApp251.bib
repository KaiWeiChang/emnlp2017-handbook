  abstract  = {Several approaches have been proposed to model either the explicit sequential
	structure of an argumentative text or its implicit hierarchical structure. So
	far, the adequacy of these models of overall argumentation remains unclear.
	This paper asks what type of structure is actually important to tackle
	downstream tasks in computational argumentation. We analyze patterns in the
	overall argumentation of texts from three corpora. Then, we adapt the idea of
	positional tree kernels in order to capture sequential and hierarchical
	argumentative structure together for the first time. In systematic experiments
	for three text classification tasks, we find strong evidence for the impact of
	both types of structure. Our results suggest that either of them is necessary
	while their combination may be beneficial.},
