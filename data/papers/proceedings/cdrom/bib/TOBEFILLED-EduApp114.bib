  abstract  = {Research in computational semantics is increasingly guided by our understanding
	of human semantic processing. However, semantic models are typically studied in
	the context of natural language processing system performance. In this paper,
	we present a systematic evaluation and comparison of a range of widely-used,
	state-of-the-art semantic models in their ability to predict patterns of
	conceptual representation in the human brain. Our results provide new insights
	both for the design of computational semantic models and for further research
	in cognitive neuroscience.},
