  abstract  = {This paper addresses the automatic recognition of telicity, an aspectual
	notion. A telic event includes a natural endpoint ("she walked home"), while an
	atelic event does not ("she walked around"). Recognizing this difference is a
	prerequisite for temporal natural language understanding. In English, this
	classification task is difficult, as telicity is a covert linguistic category.
	In contrast, in Slavic languages, aspect is part of a verb's meaning and even
	available in machine-readable dictionaries. Our contributions are as follows.
	We successfully leverage additional silver standard training data in the form
	of projected annotations from parallel English-Czech data as well as context
	information, improving automatic telicity classification for English
	significantly compared to previous work. We also create a new data set of
	English texts manually annotated with telicity.},
