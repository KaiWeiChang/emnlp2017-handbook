  abstract  = {We introduce globally normalized convolutional neural networks for joint entity
	classification and relation extraction. In particular, we propose a way to
	utilize a linear-chain conditional random field output layer for predicting
	entity types and relations between entities at the same time. Our experiments
	show that global normalization outperforms a locally normalized softmax layer
	on a benchmark dataset.},
