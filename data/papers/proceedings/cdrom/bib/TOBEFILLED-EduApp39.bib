  abstract  = {This work presents a general unsupervised learning method to improve the
	accuracy of sequence to sequence (seq2seq) models. In our method, the weights
	of the encoder and decoder of a seq2seq model are initialized with the
	pretrained weights of two language models and then fine-tuned with labeled
	data. We apply this method to challenging benchmarks in machine translation and
	abstractive summarization and find that it significantly improves the
	subsequent supervised models.  Our main result is that pretraining improves the
	generalization of seq2seq models. We achieve state-of-the-art results on the
	WMT English$\rightarrow$German task, surpassing a range of methods using both
	phrase-based machine translation and neural machine translation. Our method
	achieves a significant improvement of 1.3 BLEU from th previous best models on
	both WMT'14 and WMT'15 English$\rightarrow$German. We also conduct human
	evaluations on abstractive summarization and find that our method outperforms a
	purely supervised learning baseline in a statistically significant manner.},
