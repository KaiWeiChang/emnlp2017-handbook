  abstract  = {We present an analytic study on the language of news media in the context of
	political fact-checking and fake news detection. We compare the language of
	real news with that of satire, hoaxes, and propaganda to find linguistic
	characteristics of untrustworthy text. To probe the feasibility of automatic
	political fact-checking, we also present a case study based on PolitiFact.com
	using their factuality judgments on a 6-point scale. Experiments show that
	while media fact-checking remains to be an open research question, stylistic
	cues can help determine the truthfulness of text.},
