  abstract  = {Highlighting the recurrence of topics usage in candidates speeches is a key
	feature to identify the main ideas of each candidate during a political
	campaign. In this paper, we present a method combining standard topic modeling
	with signature mining for analyzing topic recurrence in speeches of Clinton and
	Trump during the 2016 American presidential campaign. The results show that the
	method extracts automatically the main ideas of each candidate and, in
	addition, provides information about the evolution of these topics during the
	campaign.},
