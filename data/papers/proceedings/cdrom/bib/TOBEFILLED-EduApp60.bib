  abstract  = {Although many sentiment lexicons in different languages exist, most are not
	comprehensive. In a recent sentiment analysis application, we used a large
	Chinese sentiment lexicon and found that it missed a large number of sentiment
	words in social media. This prompted us to make a new attempt to study
	sentiment lexicon expansion. This paper first poses the problem as a PU
	learning problem, which is a new formulation. It then proposes a new PU
	learning method suitable for our problem using a neural network. The results
	are enhanced further with a new dictionary-based technique and a novel polarity
	classification technique. Experimental results show that the proposed approach
	outperforms baseline methods greatly.},
