  abstract  = {Universal Dependencies (UD) offer a uniform cross-lingual syntactic
	representation, with the aim of advancing multilingual applications. Recent
	work shows that semantic parsing can be accomplished by transforming syntactic
	dependencies to logical forms. However, this work is limited to English, and
	cannot process dependency graphs, which allow handling complex phenomena such
	as control. In this work, we introduce UDepLambda, a semantic interface for UD,
	which maps natural language to logical forms in an almost language-independent
	fashion and can process dependency graphs. We perform experiments on question
	answering against Freebase and provide German and Spanish translations of the
	WebQuestions and GraphQuestions datasets to facilitate multilingual evaluation.
	Results show that UDepLambda outperforms strong baselines across languages and
	datasets.  For English, it achieves a 4.9 F1 point improvement over the
	state-of-the-art on GraphQuestions.},
