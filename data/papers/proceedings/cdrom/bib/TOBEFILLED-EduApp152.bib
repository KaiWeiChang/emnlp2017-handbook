  abstract  = {Bilingual Lexicon Induction is the task of learning  word  translations 
	without  bilingual parallel corpora. We model this task as a matrix completion
	problem, and present an effective and extendable framework for completing the
	matrix. This method harnesses diverse bilingual and monolingual signals, each
	of which may be incomplete or noisy. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
	performance for both high and low resource languages.},
