  abstract  = {We propose an approach to N -best list re-
	ranking using neural sequence-labelling
	models. We train a compositional model
	for error detection that calculates the prob-
	ability of each token in a sentence being
	correct or incorrect, utilising the full sen-
	tence as context. Using the error detec-
	tion model, we then re-rank the N best
	hypotheses generated by statistical ma-
	chine translation systems. Our approach
	achieves state-of-the-art results on error
	correction for three different datasets, and
	it has the additional advantage of only us-
	ing a small set of easily computed features
	that require no linguistic input.},
