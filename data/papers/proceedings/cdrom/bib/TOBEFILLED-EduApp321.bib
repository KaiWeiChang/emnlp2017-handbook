  abstract  = {Concept maps can be used to concisely represent important information and bring
	structure into large document collections. Therefore, we study a variant of
	multi-document summarization that produces summaries in the form of concept
	maps. However, suitable evaluation datasets for this task are currently
	missing. To close this gap, we present a newly created corpus of concept maps
	that summarize heterogeneous collections of web documents on educational
	topics. It was created using a novel crowdsourcing approach that allows us to
	efficiently determine important elements in large document collections. We
	release the corpus along with a baseline system and proposed evaluation
	protocol to enable further research on this variant of summarization.},
