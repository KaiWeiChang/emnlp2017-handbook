  abstract  = {Idioms are peculiar linguistic constructions that impose great challenges for
	representing the semantics of language, especially in current prevailing
	end-to-end neural models, which assume that the semantics of a phrase or
	sentence can be literally composed from its constitutive words.
	In this paper, we propose an idiom-aware distributed semantic model to build
	representation of sentences on the basis of understanding their contained
	idioms. Our models are grounded in the literal-first psycholinguistic
	hypothesis, which can adaptively learn semantic compositionality of a phrase
	literally or idiomatically. To better evaluate our models, we also construct an
	idiom-enriched sentiment classification dataset with considerable scale and
	abundant peculiarities of idioms. The qualitative and quantitative experimental
	analyses demonstrate the efficacy of our models.
