  abstract  = {We introduce a novel sub-character architecture that exploits a unique
	compositional structure of the Korean language. Our method decomposes each
	character into a small set of primitive phonetic units called jamo letters from
	which character- and word-level representations are induced. The jamo letters
	divulge syntactic and semantic information that is difficult to access with
	conventional character-level units. They greatly alleviate the data sparsity
	problem, reducing the observation space to 1.6% of the original while
	increasing accuracy in our experiments. We apply our architecture to dependency
	parsing and achieve dramatic improvement over strong lexical baselines.},
