  abstract  = {We present a topic-based analysis of agreement and disagreement in political
	manifestos, which relies on a new method for topic detection based on key
	concept  clustering. Our approach outperforms both standard techniques like LDA
	and a state-of-the-art graph-based method, and provides promising initial
	results for this new task in computational social science.},
