  abstract  = {We introduce the task of book structure labeling: segmenting and assigning a
	fixed category (such as Table of Contents, Preface, Index) to the document
	structure of printed books.  We manually annotate the page-level structural
	categories for a large dataset totaling 294,816 pages in 1,055 books evenly
	sampled from 1750-1922, and present empirical results comparing the performance
	of several classes of models.  The best-performing model, a bidirectional LSTM
	with rich features, achieves an overall accuracy of 95.8 and a class-balanced
	macro F-score of 71.4.},
