  abstract  = {Verifiability is one of the core editing principles in Wikipedia, where editors
	are encouraged to provide  citations for the added content. For a Wikipedia
	article determining what content is covered by a citation or the citation span
	is not trivial, an important aspect for automated citation finding for
	uncovered content, or fact assessments.
	We address the problem of determining the citation span in Wikipedia articles.
	We approach this problem by classifying which textual fragments in an article
	are covered or hold true given a citation. We propose a sequence classification
	approach where for a paragraph and a citation, we determine the citation span
	at a fine-grained
	level.
	We provide a thorough experimental evaluation and compare our approach against
	baselines adopted from the scientific domain, where we show improvement for all
	evaluation metrics.},
