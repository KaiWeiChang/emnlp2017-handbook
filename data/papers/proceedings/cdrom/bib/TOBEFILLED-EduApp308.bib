  abstract  = {We propose a novel LSTM-based deep multi-task learning framework for aspect
	term extraction from user review sentences. Two LSTMs equipped with extended
	memories and neural memory operations are designed for jointly handling the
	extraction tasks of aspects and opinions via memory interactions. Sentimental
	sentence constraint is also added for more accurate prediction via another
	LSTM. Experiment results over two benchmark datasets demonstrate the
	effectiveness of our framework.},
