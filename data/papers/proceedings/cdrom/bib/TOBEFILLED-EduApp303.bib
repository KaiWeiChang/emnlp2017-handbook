  abstract  = {In the logic approach to Recognizing Textual Entailment, identifying
	phrase-to-phrase semantic relations is still an unsolved problem. Resources
	such as the Paraphrase Database offer limited coverage despite their large size
	whereas unsupervised distributional models of meaning often fail to recognize
	phrasal entailments. We propose to map phrases to their visual denotations and
	compare their meaning in terms of their images. We show that our approach is
	effective in the task of Recognizing Textual Entailment when combined with
	specific linguistic and logic features.},
