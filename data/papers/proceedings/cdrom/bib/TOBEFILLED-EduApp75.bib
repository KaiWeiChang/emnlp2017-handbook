  abstract  = {The generation of complex derived word forms has been an overlooked problem in
	NLP; we fill this gap by applying neural sequence-to-sequence models to the
	task. We overview the theoretical motivation for a paradigmatic treatment of
	derivational morphology, and introduce the task of derivational paradigm
	completion as a parallel to inflectional paradigm completion. State-of-the-art
	neural models adapted from the inflection task are able to learn the range of
	derivation patterns, and outperform a non-neural baseline by 16.4%. However,
	due to semantic, historical, and lexical considerations involved in
	derivational morphology, future work will be needed to achieve performance
	parity with inflection-generating systems.},
