  abstract  = {Word embeddings are used with success for a variety of tasks involving lexical
	semantic similarities between individual words. Using unsupervised methods and
	just cosine similarity, encouraging results were obtained for analogical
	similarities. In this paper, we explore the potential of pre-trained word
	embeddings to identify generic types of semantic relations in an unsupervised
	experiment. We propose a new relational similarity measure based on the
	combination of word2vec's CBOW input and output vectors which outperforms
	concurrent vector representations, when used for unsupervised clustering on
	SemEval 2010 Relation Classification data.},
