  abstract  = {We present an approach for answering questions that span multiple sentences and
	exhibit sophisticated cross-sentence anaphoric phenomena, evaluating on a rich
	source of such questions -- the math portion of the Scholastic Aptitude Test
	(SAT). By using a tree transducer cascade as its basic architecture, our system
	propagates uncertainty from multiple sources (e.g. coreference resolution or
	verb interpretation) until it can be confidently resolved. Experiments show the
	first-ever results 43% recall and 91% precision) on SAT algebra word problems.
	We also apply our system to the public Dolphin algebra question set, and
	improve the state-of-the-art F1-score from 73.9% to 77.0%.},
