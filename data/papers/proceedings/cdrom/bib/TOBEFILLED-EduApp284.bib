  abstract  = {We present experiments that show the influence of native language on lexical
	choice when producing text in another language -- in this particular case
	English. We start from the premise that non-native English speakers will choose
	lexical items that are close to words in their native language. This leads us
	to an etymology-based representation of documents written by people whose
	mother tongue is an Indo-European language. Based on this representation we
	grow a language family tree, that matches closely the Indo-European language
	tree.},
