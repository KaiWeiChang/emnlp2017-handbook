  abstract  = {In this paper, we model the problem of disfluency detection using a
	transition-based framework, which incrementally constructs and labels the
	disfluency chunk of input sentences using a new transition system without
	syntax information. Compared with sequence labeling methods, it can capture
	non-local chunk-level features; compared with joint parsing and disfluency
	detection methods, it is free for noise in syntax. Experiments show that our
	model achieves state-of-the-art f-score of 87.5\% on the commonly used English
	Switchboard test set, and a set of  in-house annotated Chinese data.},
