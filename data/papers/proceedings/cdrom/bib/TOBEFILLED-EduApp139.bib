  abstract  = {Selectional preferences have long been claimed to be essential for coreference
	resolution. However, they are modeled only implicitly by current coreference
	resolvers. We propose a dependency-based embedding model of selectional
	preferences which allows fine-grained compatibility judgments with high
	coverage. Incorporating our model improves performance, matching
	state-of-the-art results of a more complex system. However, it comes with a
	cost that makes it debatable how worthwhile are such improvements.},
