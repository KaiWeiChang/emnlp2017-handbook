  abstract  = {Portmanteaus are a word formation phenomenon where two words combine into a new
	word. We propose character-level neural sequence-to-sequence (S2S) methods for
	the task of portmanteau generation that are end-to-end-trainable, language
	independent, and do not explicitly use additional phonetic information. We
	propose a noisy-channel-style model, which allows for the incorporation of
	unsupervised word lists, improving performance over a standard source-to-target
	model. This model is made possible by an exhaustive candidate generation
	strategy specifically enabled by the features of the portmanteau task.
	Experiments find our approach superior to a state-of-the-art FST-based baseline
	with respect to ground truth accuracy and human evaluation.},
