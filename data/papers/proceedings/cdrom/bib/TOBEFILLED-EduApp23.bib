  abstract  = {The existing word representation methods mostly limit their information source
	to word co-occurrence statistics. In this paper, we introduce ngrams into four
	representation methods: SGNS, GloVe, PPMI matrix, and its SVD factorization.
	Comprehensive experiments are conducted on word analogy and similarity tasks.
	The results show that improved word representations are learned from ngram
	co-occurrence statistics. We also demonstrate that the trained ngram
	representations are useful in many aspects such as finding antonyms and
	collocations. Besides, a novel approach of building co-occurrence matrix is
	proposed to alleviate the hardware burdens brought by ngrams.},
