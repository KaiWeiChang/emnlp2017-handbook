  abstract  = {Sequence-to-sequence models have shown promising  improvements on the temporal
	task of video captioning, but they optimize word-level cross-entropy loss
	during training. First, using policy gradient and mixed-loss methods for
	reinforcement learning,  we directly optimize sentence-level task-based metrics
	(as rewards), achieving significant improvements over the baseline, based on
	both automatic metrics and human evaluation on multiple datasets. Next, we
	propose a novel entailment-enhanced reward (CIDEnt) that corrects
	phrase-matching based metrics (such as CIDEr) to only allow for
	logically-implied partial matches and avoid contradictions, achieving further
	significant improvements over the CIDEr-reward model. Overall, our
	CIDEnt-reward model achieves the new state-of-the-art on the MSR-VTT dataset.},
