  abstract  = {We present a transition-based AMR parser that directly generates AMR parses
	from plain text. 
	We use Stack-LSTMs to represent our parser state and make decisions greedily.
	In our experiments, we show that our parser achieves very competitive scores on
	English using only AMR training data. Adding additional information, such as
	POS tags and dependency trees, improves the results further.},
