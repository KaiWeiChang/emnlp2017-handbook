  abstract  = {We develop a technique for transfer learning in machine comprehension (MC)
	using a novel two-stage synthesis network.  Given a high performing MC model in
	one domain, our technique aims to answer questions about documents in another
	domain, where we use no labeled data of question-answer pairs. Using the
	proposed synthesis network with a pretrained model on the SQuAD dataset, we
	achieve an F1 measure of 46.6% on the challenging NewsQA dataset, approaching
	performance of in-domain models (F1 measure of 50.0%) and outperforming the
	out-of-domain baseline by 7.6%, without use of provided annotations.},
