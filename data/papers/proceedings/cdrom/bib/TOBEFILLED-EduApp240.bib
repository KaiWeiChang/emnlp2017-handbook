  abstract  = {Variations of word associations across different groups of people can provide
	insights into peopleâ€™s psychologies and their world views. To capture these
	variations, we introduce the task of demographic-aware word associations. We
	build a new gold standard dataset consisting of word association responses for
	approximately 300 stimulus words, collected from more than 800 respondents of
	different gender (male/female) and from different locations (India/United
	States), and show that there are significant variations in the word
	associations made by these groups. We also introduce a new demographic-aware
	word association model based on a neural net skip-gram architecture, and show
	how computational methods for measuring word associations that specifically
	account for writer demographics can outperform generic methods that are
	agnostic to such information.},
