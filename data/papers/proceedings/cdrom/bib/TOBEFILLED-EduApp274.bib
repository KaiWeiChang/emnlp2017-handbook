  abstract  = {In this paper, we propose a new model that is capable of recognizing
	overlapping mentions. We introduce a novel notion of mention separators that
	can be effectively used to capture how mentions overlap with one another. On
	top of a novel multigraph representation that we introduce, we show that
	efficient and exact inference can still be performed. We present some
	theoretical analysis on the differences between our model and a recently
	proposed model for recognizing overlapping mentions, and discuss the possible
	implications of the differences. Through extensive empirical analysis on
	standard datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},
