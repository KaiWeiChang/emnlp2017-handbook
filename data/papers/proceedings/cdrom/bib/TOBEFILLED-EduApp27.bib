  abstract  = {Word embeddings have attracted much attention recently. Different from
	alphabetic writing systems, Chinese characters are often composed of
	subcharacter components which are also semantically informative. In this work,
	we propose an approach to jointly embed Chinese words as well as their
	characters and fine-grained subcharacter components. We use three likelihoods
	to evaluate whether the context words, characters, and components can predict
	the current target word, and collected 13,253 subcharacter components to
	demonstrate the existing approaches of decomposing Chinese characters are not
	enough. Evaluation on both word similarity and word analogy tasks demonstrates
	the superior performance of our model.},
