  abstract  = {We propose a method for embedding two-dimensional locations in a continuous
	vector space using a neural network-based model incorporating mixtures of
	Gaussian distributions, presenting two model variants for text-based
	geolocation and lexical dialectology. Evaluated over Twitter data, the proposed
	model outperforms conventional regression-based geolocation and provides a
	better estimate of uncertainty. We also show the effectiveness of the
	representation for predicting words from location in lexical dialectology, and
	evaluate it using the DARE dataset.},
