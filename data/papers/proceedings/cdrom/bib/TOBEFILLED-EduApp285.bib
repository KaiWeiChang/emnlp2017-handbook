  abstract  = {Story detection is the task of determining whether or not a unit of text
	contains a story. Prior approaches achieved a maximum performance of 0.66 F1,
	and did not generalize well across different corpora. We present a new
	state-of-the-art detector that achieves a maximum performance of 0.75 F1 (a 14%
	improvement), with significantly greater generalizability than previous work.
	In particular, our detector achieves performance above 0.70 F1 across a variety
	of combinations of lexically different corpora for training and testing, as
	well as dramatic improvements (up to 4,000%) in performance when trained on a
	small, disfluent data set. The new detector uses two basic types of
	features--ones related to events, and ones related to characters--totaling
	283 specific features overall; previous detectors used tens of thousands of
	features, and so this detector represents a significant simplification along
	with increased performance.},
