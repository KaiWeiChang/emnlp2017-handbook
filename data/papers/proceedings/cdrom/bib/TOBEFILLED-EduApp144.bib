  abstract  = {In order to determine argument structure in text, one must understand how
	individual components of the overall argument are linked. This work presents
	the first neural network-based approach to link extraction in argument mining.
	Specifically, we propose a novel architecture that applies Pointer Network
	sequence-to-sequence attention modeling to structural prediction in discourse
	parsing tasks. We then develop a joint model that extends this architecture to
	simultaneously address the link extraction task and the classification of
	argument components. The proposed joint model achieves state-of-the-art results
	on two separate evaluation corpora, showing far superior performance than the
	previously proposed corpus-specific and heavily feature-engineered models.
	Furthermore, our results demonstrate that jointly optimizing for both tasks is
	crucial for high performance.},
