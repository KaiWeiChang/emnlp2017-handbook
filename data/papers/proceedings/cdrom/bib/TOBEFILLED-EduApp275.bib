  abstract  = {We propose a novel deep learning model for joint document-level entity
	disambiguation, which leverages learned neural representations. Key components
	are entity embeddings, a neural attention mechanism over local context windows,
	and a differentiable joint inference stage for disambiguation. Our approach
	thereby combines benefits of deep learning with more traditional approaches
	such as graphical models and probabilistic mention-entity maps. Extensive
	experiments show that we are able to obtain competitive or state-of-the-art
	accuracy at moderate computational costs.},
