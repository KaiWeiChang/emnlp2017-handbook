  abstract  = {This paper presents a deep neural solver to automatically solve math word
	problems. In contrast to previous statistical learning approaches, we directly
	translate math word problems to equation templates using a recurrent neural
	network (RNN) model, without sophisticated feature engineering. We further
	design a hybrid model that combines the RNN model and a similarity-based
	retrieval model to achieve additional performance improvement. Experiments
	conducted on a large dataset show that the RNN model and the hybrid model
	significantly outperform state-of-the-art statistical learning methods for math
	word problem solving.},
