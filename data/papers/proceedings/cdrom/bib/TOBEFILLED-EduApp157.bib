  abstract  = {This paper describes an empirical study of the phrase-based decoding algorithm
	proposed by Chang and Collins (2017).  The algorithm produces a translation by
	processing the source-language sentence in strictly left-to-right order,
	differing from commonly used approaches that build the target-language sentence
	in left-to-right order. Our results show that the new algorithm is competitive
	with Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) in terms of both speed and BLEU scores.},
