  abstract  = {This paper presents a corpus and experiments to determine dimensions of
	interpersonal relationships. We define a set of dimensions heavily inspired by
	work in social science. We create a corpus by retrieving pairs of people, and
	then annotating dimensions for their relationships. A corpus analysis shows
	that dimensions can be annotated reliably. Experimental results show that given
	a pair of people, values to dimensions can be assigned automatically.},
