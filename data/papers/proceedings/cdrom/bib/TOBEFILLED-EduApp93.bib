  abstract  = {In this paper, we propose to use a set of simple, uniform in architecture
	LSTM-based models to recover different kinds of temporal relations from text.
	Using the shortest dependency path between entities as input, the same
	architecture is used to extract intra-sentence, cross-sentence, and document
	creation time relations. A ``double-checking'' technique reverses entity pairs
	in classification, boosting the recall of positive cases and reducing
	misclassifications between opposite classes. An efficient pruning algorithm
	resolves conflicts globally. Evaluated on QA-TempEval (SemEval2015 Task 5), our
	proposed technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. We
	also conduct intrinsic evaluation and post state-of-the-art results on
	Timebank-Dense.},
