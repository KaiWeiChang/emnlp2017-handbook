  abstract  = {Verbs can only be used with a few specific arrangements of their arguments
	(syntactic frames). Most theorists note that verbs can be organized into a
	hierarchy of verb classes based on the frames they admit. Here we show that
	such a hierarchy is objectively well-supported by the patterns of verbs and
	frames in English, since a systematic hierarchical clustering algorithm
	converges on the same structure as the handcrafted taxonomy of VerbNet, a
	broad-coverage verb lexicon. We also show that the hierarchies capture
	meaningful psychological dimensions of generalization by predicting novel verb
	coercions by human participants. We discuss limitations of a simple
	hierarchical representation and suggest similar approaches for identifying the
	representations underpinning verb argument structure.},
