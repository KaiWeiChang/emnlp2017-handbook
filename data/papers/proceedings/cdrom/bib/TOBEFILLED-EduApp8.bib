  abstract  = {Annotating large numbers of sentences with senses is the heaviest requirement
	of current Word Sense Disambiguation. We present Train-O-Matic, a
	language-independent method for generating millions of sense-annotated training
	instances for virtually all meanings of words in a language's vocabulary. The
	approach is fully automatic: no human intervention is required and the only
	type of human knowledge used is a WordNet-like resource. Train-O-Matic achieves
	consistently state-of-the-art performance across gold standard datasets and
	languages, while at the same time removing the burden of manual annotation. All
	the training data is available for research purposes at http://trainomatic.org.},
