  abstract  = {Discourse parsing has long been treated as a stand-alone problem independent
	from constituency or dependency parsing. Most attempts at this problem rely on
	annotated text segmentations (Elementary Discourse Units, EDUs) and
	sophisticated sparse or continuous features to extract syntactic information.
	In this paper we propose the first end-to-end discourse parser that jointly
	parses in both syntax and discourse levels, as well as the first
	syntactic-discourse treebank by integrating the Penn Treebank and the RST
	Treebank. Built upon our recent span-based constituency parser, this joint
	syntactic-discourse parser requires no preprocessing efforts such as
	segmentation or feature extraction, making discourse parsing more convenient.
	Empirically, our parser achieves the state-of-the-art end-to-end discourse
	parsing accuracy.},
