  abstract  = {We interpret the predictions of any black-box structured input-structured
	output model around a specific input-output pair. Our method returns an
	"explanation" consisting of groups of input-output tokens that are causally
	related.  These dependencies are inferred by querying the model with perturbed
	inputs, generating a graph over tokens from the responses, and solving a
	partitioning problem to select the most relevant components. We focus the
	general approach on sequence-to-sequence problems, adopting a variational
	autoencoder to yield meaningful input perturbations. We test our method across
	several NLP sequence generation tasks.},
