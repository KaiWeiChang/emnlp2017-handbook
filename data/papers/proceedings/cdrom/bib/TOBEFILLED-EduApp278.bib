  abstract  = {In domain-specific NER, due to insufficient labeled training data, deep models
	usually fail to behave normally. In this paper, we proposed a novel Neural
	Inductive TEaching framework (NITE) to transfer knowledge from existing
	domain-specific NER models into an arbitrary deep neural network in a
	teacher-student training manner. NITE is a general framework that builds upon
	transfer learning and multiple instance learning, which collaboratively not
	only transfers knowledge to a deep student network but also reduces the noise
	from teachers. NITE can help deep learning methods to effectively utilize
	existing resources (i.e., models, labeled and unlabeled data) in a small
	domain. The experiment resulted on Disease NER proved that without using any
	labeled data, NITE can significantly boost the performance of a
	CNN-bidirectional LSTM-CRF NER neural network nearly over 30% in terms of
	F1-score.},
