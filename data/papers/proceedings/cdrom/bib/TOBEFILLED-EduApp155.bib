  abstract  = {Instance weighting has been widely applied to phrase-based machine translation
	domain adaptation. However, it is challenging to be applied to Neural Machine
	Translation (NMT) directly, because NMT is not a linear model. In this paper,
	two instance weighting technologies, i.e., sentence weighting and domain
	weighting with a dynamic weight learning strategy, are proposed for NMT domain
	adaptation. Empirical results on the IWSLT English-German/French tasks show
	that the proposed methods can substantially improve NMT performance by up to
	2.7-6.7 BLEU points, outperforming the existing baselines by up to 1.6-3.6 BLEU
	points.},
