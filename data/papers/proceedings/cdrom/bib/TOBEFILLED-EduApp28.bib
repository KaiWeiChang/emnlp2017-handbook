  abstract  = {We present an unsupervised, language agnostic approach for exploiting
	morphological regularities present in high dimensional vector spaces. We
	propose a novel method for generating embeddings of words from their
	morphological variants using morphological transformation operators. We
	evaluate this approach on MSR word analogy test set with an accuracy of 85%
	which is 12% higher than the previous best known system.},
