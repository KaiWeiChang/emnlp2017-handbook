  abstract  = {Even for common NLP tasks, sufficient supervision is not available in many
	languages -- morphological tagging is no exception. In the work presented here,
	we explore a transfer learning scheme, whereby we train character-level
	recurrent neural taggers to predict morphological taggings for high-resource
	languages and low-resource languages together. Learning joint character
	representations among multiple related languages successfully enables knowledge
	transfer from the high-resource languages to the low-resource ones.},
