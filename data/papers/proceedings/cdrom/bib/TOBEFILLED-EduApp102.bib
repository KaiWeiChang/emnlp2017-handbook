  abstract  = {We address the problem of end-to-end visual storytelling. 
	Given a photo album, our model first selects the most representative (summary)
	photos, and then composes a natural language story for the album.
	For this task, we make use of the Visual Storytelling dataset and a model
	composed of three hierarchically-attentive Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs) to:
	encode the album photos, select representative (summary) photos, and  compose
	the story. Automatic and human evaluations show our model achieves better
	performance on
	selection, generation, and retrieval than baselines.},
