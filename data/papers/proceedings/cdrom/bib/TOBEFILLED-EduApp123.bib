  abstract  = {Sentence pair modeling is a crucial problem in the field of natural language
	processing. 
	In this paper, we propose a model to measure the similarity of a sentence pair
	focusing on the interaction information. We utilize the word level similarity
	matrix to discover fine-grained alignment of two sentences. It should be
	emphasized that each word in a sentence has a different importance from the
	perspective of semantic composition, so we exploit two novel and efficient
	strategies to explicitly calculate a weight for each word. Although the
	proposed model only use a sequential LSTM for sentence modeling without any
	external resource such as syntactic parser tree and additional lexicon
	features, experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art
	performance on three datasets of two tasks.},
