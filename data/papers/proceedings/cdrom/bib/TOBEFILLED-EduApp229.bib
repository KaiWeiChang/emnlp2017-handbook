  abstract  = {Previous work on dialog act (DA) classification has investigated different
	methods, such as hidden Markov models, maximum entropy, conditional random
	fields, graphical models, and support vector machines.
	A few recent studies explored using deep learning neural networks for DA
	classification, however, it is not clear yet what is the best method for using
	dialog context or DA sequential information, and how much gain it brings. This
	paper proposes several ways of using context information for DA classification,
	all in the deep learning framework. The baseline system classifies each
	utterance using the convolutional neural networks (CNN). Our proposed methods
	include using hierarchical models (recurrent neural networks (RNN) or CNN) for
	DA sequence tagging where the bottom layer takes the sentence CNN
	representation as input, concatenating predictions from the previous utterances
	with the CNN vector for classification, and performing sequence decoding based
	on the predictions from the sentence CNN model. 
	We conduct thorough experiments and comparisons on the Switchboard corpus,
	demonstrate that incorporating context information significantly improves DA
	classification, and show that we achieve new state-of-the-art performance for
	this task.},
