  abstract  = {Identification of intensity ordering among polar (positive or negative) words
	which have the same semantics can lead to a fine-grained sentiment analysis.
	For
	example, 'master', 'seasoned' and 'familiar' point to different intensity
	levels, though they all convey the same meaning (semantics), i.e., expertise:
	having a good
	knowledge of. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised technique that uses
	sentiment
	bearing word embeddings to produce a continuous ranking among adjectives that
	share common semantics. Our system demonstrates a strong Spearmanâ€™s rank
	correlation of 0.83 with the gold standard ranking. We show that sentiment
	bearing word embeddings facilitate a more accurate intensity ranking system
	than other standard word embeddings (word2vec and GloVe). Word2vec is the
	state-of-the-art for intensity ordering task.},
