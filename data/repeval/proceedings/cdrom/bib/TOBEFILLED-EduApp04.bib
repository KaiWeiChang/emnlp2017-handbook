  abstract  = {Acquiring language provides a ubiquitous mode of communication, across humans
	and robots. To this effect, distributional representations of words based on
	co-occurrence statistics, have provided significant advancements ranging across
	machine translation to comprehension. In this paper, we study the suitability
	of using general purpose word-embeddings for language learning in robots. We
	propose using text-based games as a proxy to evaluating word embedding on real
	robots. Based in a risk-reward setting, we review the effectiveness of the
	embeddings in navigating tasks in fantasy games, as an approximation to their
	performance on more complex scenarios, like language assisted robot navigation.},
