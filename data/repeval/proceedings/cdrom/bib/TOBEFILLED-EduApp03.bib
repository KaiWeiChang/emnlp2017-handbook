  abstract  = {This work presents a framework for word similarity evaluation grounded on
	cognitive sciences experimental data. Word pair similarities are compared to
	reaction times of subjects in large scale lexical decision and naming tasks
	under semantic priming. Results show that GloVe embeddings lead to
	significantly higher correlation with experimental measurements than other
	controlled and off-the-shelf embeddings, and that the choice of a training
	corpus is less important than that of the algorithm. Comparison of rankings
	with other datasets shows that the cognitive phenomenon covers more aspects
	than simply word relatedness or similarity.},
