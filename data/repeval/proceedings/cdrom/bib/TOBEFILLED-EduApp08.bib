  abstract  = {Natural language inference (NLI) is a central problem in language
	understanding. End-to-end artificial neural networks have reached
	state-of-the-art  performance in NLI field recently. In this paper, we propose
	Character-level Intra Attention Network (CIAN) for the NLI task. In our model,
	we use the character-level convolutional network to replace the standard word
	embedding layer, and we use the intra attention to capture the intra-sentence
	semantics. The proposed CIAN model provides improved results based on a newly
	published MNLI corpus.},
