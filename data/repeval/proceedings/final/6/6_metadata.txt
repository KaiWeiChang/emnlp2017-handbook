Abstract#==#This work presents a framework for word similarity evaluation grounded on
cognitive sciences experimental data. Word pair similarities are compared to
reaction times of subjects in large scale lexical decision and naming tasks
under semantic priming. Results show that GloVe embeddings lead to
significantly higher correlation with experimental measurements than other
controlled and off-the-shelf embeddings, and that the choice of a training
corpus is less important than that of the algorithm. Comparison of rankings
with other datasets shows that the cognitive phenomenon covers more aspects
than simply word relatedness or similarity.
