Abstract#==#In this paper, we investigate the application of machine learning techniques
and word embeddings to the task of Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) in
Social Media. We look at a manually labeled dataset consisting of user
generated short texts posted on Twitter (tweets) and related to four recent
media events (the Charlie Hebdo shooting, the Ottawa shooting, the Sydney
Siege, and the German Wings crash) and test to what extent neural techniques
and embeddings are able to distinguish between tweets that entail or contradict
each other or that claim unrelated things. We obtain comparable results to the
state of the art in a train-test setting, but we show that, due to the noisy
aspect of the data, results plummet in an evaluation strategy crafted to better
simulate a real-life train-test scenario.
