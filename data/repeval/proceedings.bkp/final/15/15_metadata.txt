Abstract#==#Acquiring language provides a ubiquitous mode of communication, across humans
and robots. To this effect, distributional representations of words based on
co-occurrence statistics, have provided significant advancements ranging across
machine translation to comprehension. In this paper, we study the suitability
of using general purpose word-embeddings for language learning in robots. We
propose using text-based games as a proxy to evaluating word embedding on real
robots. Based in a risk-reward setting, we review the effectiveness of the
embeddings in navigating tasks in fantasy games, as an approximation to their
performance on more complex scenarios, like language assisted robot navigation.
