Abstract#==#Interpretability of a predictive model is a powerful feature that gains the
trust of users in the correctness of the predictions.  In word sense
disambiguation (WSD), knowledge-based systems tend to be much more
interpretable than knowledge-free counterparts as they rely on the wealth of
manually-encoded elements representing word senses, such as hypernyms, usage
examples, and images. We present a WSD system that bridges the gap between
these two so far disconnected groups of methods. Namely, our system, providing
access to several state-of-the-art WSD models, aims to be interpretable as a
knowledge-based system while it remains completely unsupervised and
knowledge-free. The presented tool features a Web interface for all-word
disambiguation of texts that makes the sense predictions human readable by
providing interpretable word sense inventories, sense representations, and
disambiguation results. We provide a public API, enabling seamless integration.
