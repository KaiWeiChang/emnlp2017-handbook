Abstract#==#This paper introduces SGNMT, our experimental platform for machine translation
research. SGNMT provides a generic interface to neural and symbolic scoring
modules (predictors) with left-to-right semantic such as translation models
like NMT, language models, translation lattices, n-best lists or other kinds of
scores and constraints. Predictors can be combined with other predictors to
form complex decoding tasks. SGNMT implements a number of search strategies for
traversing the space spanned by the predictors which are appropriate for
different predictor constellations. Adding new predictors or decoding
strategies is particularly easy, making it a very efficient tool for
prototyping new research ideas. SGNMT is actively being used by students in the
MPhil program in Machine Learning, Speech and Language Technology at the
University of Cambridge for course work and theses, as well as for most of the
research work in our group.
