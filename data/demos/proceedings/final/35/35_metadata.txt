Abstract#==#Geographic information extraction from textual data sources, called geoparsing,
is a key task in text processing and central to subsequent spatial analysis
approaches. Several geoparsers are available that support this task, each with
its own (often limited or specialized) gazetteer and its own approaches to
toponym detection and resolution. In this demonstration paper, we present
HeidelPlace, an extensible framework in support of geoparsing. Key features of
HeidelPlace include a generic gazetteer model that supports the integration of
place information from different knowledge bases, and a pipeline approach that
enables an effective combination of diverse modules tailored to specific
geoparsing tasks. This makes HeidelPlace a valuable tool for testing and
evaluating different gazetteer sources and geoparsing methods. In the
demonstration, we show how to set up a geoparsing workflow with HeidelPlace and
how it can be used to compare and consolidate the output of different
geoparsing approaches.
