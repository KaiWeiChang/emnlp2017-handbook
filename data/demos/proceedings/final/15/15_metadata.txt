Abstract#==#Previous works proposed annotation projection in parallel corpora to
inexpensively generate treebanks or propbanks for new languages. In this
approach, linguistic annotation is automatically transferred from a
resource-rich source language (SL) to translations in a target language (TL).
However, annotation projection may be adversely affected by translational
divergences between specific language pairs. For this reason, previous work
often required careful qualitative analysis of projectability of specific
annotation in order to define strategies to address quality and coverage
issues. In this demonstration, we present THE PROJECTOR, an interactive GUI
designed to assist researchers in such analysis: it allows users to execute and
visually inspect annotation projection in a range of different settings. We
give an overview of the GUI, discuss use cases and illustrate how the tool can
facilitate discussions with the research community.
