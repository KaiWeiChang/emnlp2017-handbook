Abstract#==#Graphs have long been proposed as a tool to browse and navigate in a collection
of documents in order to support exploratory search. Many techniques to
automatically extract different types of graphs, showing for example entities
or concepts and different relationships between them, have been suggested.
While experimental evidence that they are indeed helpful exists for some of
them, it is largely unknown which type of graph is most helpful for a specific
exploratory task. However, carrying out experimental comparisons with human
subjects is challenging and time-consuming. Towards this end, we present the
\textit{GraphDocExplore} framework. It provides an intuitive web interface for
graph-based document exploration that is optimized for experimental user
studies. Through a generic graph interface, different methods to extract graphs
from text can be plugged into the system. Hence, they can be compared at
minimal implementation effort in an environment that ensures controlled
comparisons. The system is publicly available under an open-source license.
