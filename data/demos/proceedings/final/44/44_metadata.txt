Abstract#==#In this demonstration we present SupWSD, a Java API for supervised Word Sense
Disambiguation (WSD). This toolkit includes the implementation of a
state-of-the-art supervised WSD system, together with a Natural Language
Processing pipeline for preprocessing and feature extraction. Our aim is to
provide an easy-to-use tool for the research community, designed to be modular,
fast and scalable for training and testing on large datasets. The source code
of SupWSD is available at http://github.com/SI3P/SupWSD.
