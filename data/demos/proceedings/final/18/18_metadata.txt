Abstract#==#We present Differential Language Analysis Toolkit (DLATK), an open-source
python package and command-line tool developed for conducting social scientific
language analyses. 
While DLATK provides standard NLP pipeline steps such as tokenization or
svm-classification, its novel strengths lie in analyses useful for
psychological, health, and social studies:  

(1) incorporation of extra-linguistic structured information, 
(2) specified levels and units of analysis (e.g. document, user, community),
(3) statistical metrics for continuous outcomes, and 
(4) robust, proven, and accurate pipelines for social scientific prediction
problems.

DLATK integrates multiple popular packages (SKLearn, Mallet), enables
interactive (iPython, Jupyter) usage, and generally follows abstraction and
object oriented principles to make it easy to tie in additional libraries or
storage technologies. DLATK has thus far been used in 32 computer and social
scientific peer-reviewed publications.
