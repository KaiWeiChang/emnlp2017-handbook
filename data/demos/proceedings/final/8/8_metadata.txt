Abstract#==#We present an educational tool that integrates computational linguistics
resources for use in non-technical undergraduate language science courses. By
using the tool in conjunction with evidence-driven pedagogical case studies, we
strive to provide opportunities for students to gain an understanding of
linguistic concepts and analysis through the lens of realistic problems in
feasible ways. Case studies tend to be used in legal, business, and health
education contexts, but less in the teaching and learning of linguistics. The
approach introduced also has potential to encourage students across training
backgrounds to continue on to computational language analysis coursework.
