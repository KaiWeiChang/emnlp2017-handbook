Abstract#==#LangPro is an automated theorem prover for natural language.
Given a set of premises and a hypothesis, it is able to prove semantic
relations between them.
The prover is based on a version of analytic tableau method specially designed
for natural logic.
The proof procedure operates on logical forms that preserve linguistic
expressions to a large extent. 
%This property makes the logical forms easily obtainable from syntactic trees.
%, in particular, Combinatory Categorial Grammar derivation trees.   
The nature of proofs is deductive and transparent.
On the FraCaS and SICK textual entailment datasets, the prover achieves high
results comparable to state-of-the-art.
