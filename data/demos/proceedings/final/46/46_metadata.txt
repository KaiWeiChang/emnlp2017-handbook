Abstract#==#LangPro is an automated theorem prover for natural language.
Given a set of premises and a hypothesis, it is able to prove semantic
relations between them.
The prover is based on a version of analytic tableau method specially designed
for natural logic.
The proof procedure operates on logical forms that preserve linguistic
expressions to a large extent. 
This property makes the logical forms easily obtainable from syntactic trees.
The nature of proofs is deductive and transparent.
On the FraCaS and SICK textual entailment datasets, the theorem prover achieves
high results competitive to state-of-the-art.
