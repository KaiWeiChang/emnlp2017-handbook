Abstract#==#In this paper, we describe Function Assistant, a lightweight Python-based
toolkit for querying and exploring source code repositories using natural
language. The toolkit is designed to help end-users of a target API quickly
find information about functions through high-level natural language queries,
or descriptions. For a given text query and background API, the tool finds
candidate functions by performing a translation from the text to known
representations in the API using the semantic parsing approach of (Richardson
and Kuhn, forthcoming). Translations are automatically learned from example
text-code pairs in example APIs. The toolkit includes features for building
translation pipelines and query engines for arbitrary source code projects. To
explore this last feature, we perform new experiments on 27 well-known Python
projects hosted on Github.
