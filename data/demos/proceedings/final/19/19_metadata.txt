Abstract#==#We present QUINT, a live system for question answering over knowledge bases.
QUINT automatically learns role-aligned utterance-query templates from user
questions paired with their answers. When QUINT answers a question, it
visualizes the complete derivation sequence from the natural language utterance
to the final answer. The derivation provides an explanation of how the
syntactic structure of the question was used to derive the structure of a
SPARQL query, and how the phrases in the question were used to instantiate
different parts of the query. When an answer seems unsatisfactory, the
derivation provides valuable insights towards reformulating the question.
