Abstract#==#Semantic relation knowledge is crucial for natural language understanding. We
introduce "KnowYourNyms?", a web-based game for learning semantic relations.
While providing users with an engaging experience, the application collects
large amounts of data that can be used to improve semantic relation
classifiers. The data also broadly informs us of how people perceive the
relationships between words, providing useful insights for research in
psychology and linguistics.
