Abstract#==#We present a tool for developing tree structure
patterns that makes it easy to define
the relations among textual phrases and
create a search index for these newly defined
relations. By using the proposed
tool, users develop tree structure patterns
through abstracting syntax trees. The tool
features (1) intuitive pattern syntax, (2)
unique functions such as recursive call of
patterns and use of lexicon dictionaries,
and (3) whole workflow support for relation
development and validation. We report
the current implementation of the tool
and its effectiveness.
