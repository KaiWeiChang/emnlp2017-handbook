Abstract#==#We introduce ParlAI (pronounced “par-lay”), an open-source software
platform for dialog research implemented in Python, available at
http://parl.ai. 
Its goal is to provide a unified framework for sharing, training and testing
dialog models; integration of Amazon Mechanical Turk for data collection, human
evaluation, and online/reinforcement learning; and a repository of machine
learning models for comparing with others' models, and improving upon existing
architectures.
Over 20 tasks are supported in the first
release, including popular datasets such as SQuAD, bAbI tasks, MCTest, WikiQA,
QACNN, QADailyMail, CBT, bAbI Dialog, Ubuntu, OpenSubtitles and VQA.
Several models are integrated, including neural models such as memory networks,
seq2seq and attentive LSTMs.
