Abstract#==#We present a semi-supervised way of training a character-based encoder-decoder
recurrent neural network for morphological reinflection---the task of
generating one inflected wordform from another. This is achieved by using
unlabeled tokens or random strings as training data for an autoencoding task,
adapting a network for morphological reinflection, and performing multi-task
training.
We thus use limited labeled data more effectively, obtaining up to 9.92%
improvement over state-of-the-art baselines for 8 different languages.
