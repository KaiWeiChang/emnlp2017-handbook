Abstract#==#We propose a new type of subword embedding designed to provide more information
about unknown compounds, a major source for OOV words in German. We present an
extrinsic evaluation where we use the compound embeddings as input to a neural
dependency parser and compare the results to the ones obtained with other types
of embeddings. Our evaluation shows that adding compound embeddings yields a
significant improvement of 2% LAS over using word embeddings when no POS
information is available. When adding POS embeddings to the input, however,
the effect levels out. This suggests that it is not the missing information
about the semantics of the unknown words that causes problems for parsing
German, but the lack of morphological information for unknown words. To augment
our evaluation, we also test the new embeddings in a language modelling task
that requires both syntactic and semantic information.
