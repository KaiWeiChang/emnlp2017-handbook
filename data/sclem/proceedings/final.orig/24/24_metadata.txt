Abstract#==#We explore the use of segments learnt using Byte Pair Encoding (referred to as
BPE units) as basic units for statistical machine translation between related
languages and compare it with orthographic syllables, which are currently the
best performing basic units for this translation task. BPE identifies the most
frequent character sequences as basic units, while orthographic syllables are
linguistically motivated pseudo-syllables. We show that BPE units modestly
outperform orthographic syllables as units of translation, showing up to 11%
increase in BLEU score. While orthographic syllables can be used only for
languages whose writing systems use vowel representations, BPE is writing
system independent and we show that BPE outperforms other units for non-vowel
writing systems too. Our results are supported by extensive experimentation
spanning multiple language families and writing systems.
