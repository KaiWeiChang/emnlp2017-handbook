Abstract#==#Word embedding has become a fundamental component to many NLP tasks such as
named entity recognition and machine translation. However, popular models that
learn such embeddings are unaware of the morphology of words, so it is not
directly applicable to highly agglutinative languages such as Korean. We
propose a syllable-based learning model for Korean using a convolutional neural
network, in which word representation is composed of trained syllable vectors.
Our model successfully produces morphologically meaningful representation of
Korean words compared to the original Skip-gram embeddings. The results also
show that it is quite robust to the Out-of-Vocabulary problem.
