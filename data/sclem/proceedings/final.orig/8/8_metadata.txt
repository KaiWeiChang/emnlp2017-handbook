Abstract#==#We consider two related problems in this paper. Given an undeciphered
alphabetic writing system or mono-alphabetic cipher, determine: (1) which of
its letters are vowels and which are consonants; and (2) whether the writing
system is a vocalic alphabet or an abjad.  We are able to show that a very
simple spectral decomposition based on character co-occurrences provides nearly
perfect performance with respect to answering both question types.
