Abstract#==#In this study we address the problem of automated word stress detection in
Russian using character level models and no part-speech-taggers. We use a
simple bidirectional RNN with LSTM nodes and achieve accuracy of 90\% or
higher. We experiment with two training datasets and show that using the data
from an annotated corpus is much more efficient than using only a dictionary,
since it allows to retain the context of the word and its morphological
features.
