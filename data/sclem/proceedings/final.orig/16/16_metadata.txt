Abstract#==#Pre-trained word embeddings improve the performance of a neural model at the
cost of increasing the model size. We propose to benefit from this resource
without paying the cost by operating strictly at the sub-lexical level. Our
approach is quite simple: before task-specific training, we first optimize
sub-word parameters to reconstruct pre-trained word embeddings using various
distance measures. We report interesting results on a variety of tasks: word
similarity, word analogy, and part-of-speech tagging.
