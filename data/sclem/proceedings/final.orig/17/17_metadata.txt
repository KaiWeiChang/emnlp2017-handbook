Abstract#==#We present a novel supervised approach to inflection generation for verbs in
Spanish. Our system takes as input the verb's lemma form and the desired
features such as person, number, tense, and is able to predict the appropriate
grammatical conjugation. Even though our approach learns from fewer examples
comparing to previous work, it is able to deal with all the Spanish moods
(indicative, subjunctive and imperative) in contrast to previous work which
only focuses on indicative and subjunctive moods. We show that in an intrinsic
evaluation, our system achieves 99% accuracy, outperforming (although not
significantly) two competitive state-of-art systems. The successful results
obtained clearly indicate that our approach could be integrated into wider
approaches related to text generation in Spanish.
