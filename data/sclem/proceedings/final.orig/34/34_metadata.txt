Abstract#==#We present a model for predicting word forms based on
    \emph{morphological relational reasoning} with analogies. While
    previous work has explored tasks such as morphological inflection
    and reinflection, these models rely on an explicit enumeration
    of morphological features, which may not be available in all cases.
    %
    To address the task of predicting a word form given a \emph{demo
      relation} (a pair of word forms) and a \emph{query word}, we
    devise a character-based recurrent neural network architecture
    using three separate encoders and a decoder.
    %
    We also investigate a multiclass learning setup, where the
    prediction of the relation type label is used as an auxiliary task.

    Our results show that the exact form can be predicted for
    English with an accuracy of 94.7\%. For Swedish, which has a more
    complex morphology with more inflectional patterns for nouns and
    verbs, the accuracy is 89.3\%. We also show that using the
    auxiliary task of learning the relation type speeds up convergence
    and improves the prediction accuracy for the word generation task.
