Abstract#==#In East Asian languages such as Japanese and Chinese, the semantics of
  a character are (somewhat) reflected in its sub-character
  elements. This paper examines the effect of using sub-characters for
  language modeling in Japanese. This is achieved by decomposing
  characters according to a range of character decomposition datasets,
  and training a neural language model over variously decomposed
  character representations. Our results indicate that language modelling
  can be improved through the inclusion of sub-characters, though this
  result depends on a good choice of decomposition dataset and the
  appropriate granularity of decomposition.
