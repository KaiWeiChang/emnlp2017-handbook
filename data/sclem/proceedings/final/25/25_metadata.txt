Abstract#==#Detecting neologisms is essential in real-time natural language processing
applications. Not only can it enable to follow the lexical evolution of
languages, but it is also essential for updating  linguistic resources and
parsers.
 In this paper, neology detection is considered as a classification task where
a system has to assess whether a given lexical item is an actual neologism or
not.
 We propose a combination of an unsupervised data mining technique and a
supervised machine learning approach.
 It is inspired by current researches in stylometry and on token-level and
character-level patterns. 
 We train and evaluate our system on a manually designed reference dataset in
French and Russian.
 We show that this approach is able to largely outperform state-of-the-art
neology detection systems. Furthermore, character-level patterns exhibit good
properties for multilingual extensions of the system.
