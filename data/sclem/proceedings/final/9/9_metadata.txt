Abstract#==#We introduce a novel method to diminish the problem of out of vocabulary words
by introducing an embedding method which leverages the agglutinative property
of language. We propose additional embedding derived from syllables and
morphemes for the words to improve the performance of language model. We apply
the above method to input prediction tasks and achieve state of the art
performance in terms of Key Stroke Saving (KSS) w.r.t. to existing device input
prediction methods.
