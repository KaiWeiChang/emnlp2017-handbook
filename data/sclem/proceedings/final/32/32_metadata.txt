Abstract#==#Most NLP resources that offer annotations at the word segment level provide
morphological annotation that includes features indicating tense, aspect,
modality, gender, case, and other inflectional information.  Such information
is rarely aligned to the relevant parts of the words---i.e. the allomorphs, as
such annotation would be very costly.  These unaligned weak labelings are
commonly provided by annotated NLP corpora such as treebanks in various
languages.  Although they lack alignment information, the presence/absence of
labels at the word level is also consistent with the amount of supervision
assumed to be provided to L1 and L2 learners. In this paper, we explore several
methods to learn this latent alignment between parts of word forms and the
grammatical information provided.  All the methods under investigation favor
hypotheses regarding allomorphs of morphemes that re-use a small inventory,
i.e. implicitly minimize the number of allomorphs that a morpheme can be
realized as.  We show that the provided information offers a significant
advantage for both word segmentation and the learning of allomorphy.
