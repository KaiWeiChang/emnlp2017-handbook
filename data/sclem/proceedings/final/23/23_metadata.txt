Abstract#==#Most of neural language models use different kinds of embeddings for
  word prediction. While word embeddings can be associated to each
  word in the vocabulary or derived from characters as well as
  factored morphological decomposition, these word representations are
  mainly used to parametrize the input, i.e. the context of
  prediction.  This work investigates the effect of using subword
  units (character and factored morphological decomposition) to build
  output representations for neural language modeling. We present a
  case study on Czech, a morphologically-rich language, experimenting
  with different input and output representations.  When working with
  the full training vocabulary, despite unstable training, our
  experiments show that augmenting the output word representations
  with character-based embeddings can significantly improve the
  performance of the model. Moreover, reducing the size of the output
  look-up table, to let the character-based embeddings represent rare
  words, brings further improvement.
