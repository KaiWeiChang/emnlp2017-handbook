Abstract#==#Recently, there has been increased interest in utilizing characters or subwords
for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the effect of utilizing
character, subword, and word-level information simultaneously has not been
examined so far. In this paper, we propose a model to leverage various levels
of input features to improve on the performance of an supersense tagging task.
Detailed analysis of experimental results show that different levels of input
representation offer distinct characteristics that explain performance
discrepancy among different tasks.
