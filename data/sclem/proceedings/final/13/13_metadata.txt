Abstract#==#There are several native languages in Peru which are mostly agglutinative.
These languages are transmitted from generation to generation mainly in oral
form, causing different forms of writing across different communities. For this
reason, there are recent efforts to standardize the spelling in the written
texts, and it would be beneficial to support these tasks with an automatic tool
such as an spell-checker. In this way, this spelling corrector is being
developed based on two steps: an automatic rule-based syllabification method
and a character-level graph to detect the degree of error in a misspelled word.
The experiments were realized on Shipibo-konibo, a highly agglutinative and
amazonian language, and the results obtained have been promising in a dataset
built for the purpose.
