Abstract#==#Sociolinguistic research suggests that speakers modulate their language style
in response to their audience. Similar effects have recently been claimed to
occur in the informal written context of Twitter, with users choosing less
region-specific and non-standard vocabulary when addressing larger audiences.
However, these studies have not carefully controlled for the possible confound
of topic: that is, tweets addressed to a broad audience might also tend towards
topics that engender a more formal style. In addition, it is not clear to what
extent previous results generalize to different samples of users. Using
mixed-effects models, we show that audience and topic have independent effects
on the rate of distinctively Scottish usage in two demographically distinct
Twitter user samples. However, not all effects are consistent between the two
groups, underscoring the importance of replicating studies on distinct user
samples before drawing strong conclusions from social media data.
