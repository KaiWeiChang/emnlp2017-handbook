Abstract#==#The differences in the frequencies of some parts of speech (POS), particularly
function words, and lexical diversity in male and female speech have been
pointed out in a number of papers. The classifiers using exclusively
context-independent parameters have proved to be highly effective. However,
there are still issues that have to be addressed as a lot of studies are
performed for English and the genre and topic of texts is sometimes neglected.
The aim of this paper is to investigate the association between
context-independent parameters of Russian written texts and the gender of their
authors and to design predictive re-gression models. A number of correlations
were found. The obtained data is in good agreement with the results obtained
for other languages. The model based on 5 parameters with the highest
correlation coefficients was designed.
