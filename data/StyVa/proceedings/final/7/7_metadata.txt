Abstract#==#The problem of detecting scientific fraud using machine learning was recently
introduced, with initial, positive results from a model taking into account
various general indicators.
The results seem to suggest that writing style is predictive of scientific
fraud. 
We revisit these initial experiments, and show that the leave-one-out testing
procedure they used likely leads to a slight over-estimate of the
predictability, 
but also that simple models can outperform their proposed model by some margin.

We go on to explore more abstract linguistic features, such as linguistic
complexity and discourse structure, only to obtain negative results. 
Upon analyzing our models, we do see some interesting patterns, though:
Scientific fraud, for examples, contains less comparison, as well as different
types of hedging and ways of presenting logical reasoning.
