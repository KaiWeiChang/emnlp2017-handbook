Abstract#==#Metaphor is one of the most studied and widespread figures of speech and an
essen- tial element of individual style. In this pa- per we look at metaphor
identification in Adjective-Noun pairs. We show that us- ing a single neural
network combined with pre-trained vector embeddings can outper- form the state
of the art in terms of accu- racy. In specific, the approach presented in this
paper is based on two ideas: a) trans- fer learning via using pre-trained
vectors representing adjective noun pairs, and b) a neural network as a model
of composition that predicts a metaphoricity score as out- put. We present
several different architec- tures for our system and evaluate their per-
formances. Variations on dataset size and on the kinds of embeddings are also
inves- tigated. We show considerable improve- ment over the previous approaches
both in terms of accuracy and w.r.t the size of an- notated training data.
