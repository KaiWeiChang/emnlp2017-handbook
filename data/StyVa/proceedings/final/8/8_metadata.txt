Abstract#==#The concept of style is much debated in theoretical as well as empirical terms.
From an empirical perspective, the key question is how to operationalize style
and thus make it accessible for annotation and quantification. In authorship
attribution, many different approaches have successfully resolved this issue at
the cost of linguistic interpretability: The resulting algorithms may be able
to distinguish one language variety from the other, but do not give us much
information on their distinctive linguistic properties. We approach the issue
of interpreting stylistic features by extracting linear and syntactic n-grams
that are distinctive for a language variety. We present a study that
exemplifies this process by a comparison of the German academic languages of
linguistics and literary studies. Overall, our findings show that distinctive
n-grams can be related to linguistic categories. The results suggest that the
style of German literary studies is characterized by nominal structures and the
style of linguistics by verbal ones.
