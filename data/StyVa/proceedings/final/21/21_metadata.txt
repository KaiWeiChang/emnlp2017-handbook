Abstract#==#Detecting and analyzing stylistic variation in language is relevant to diverse
Natural Language Processing applications. In this work, we investigate whether
salient dimensions of style variations are embedded in standard distributional
vector spaces of word meaning. We hypothesizes that distances between
embeddings of lexical paraphrases can help isolate style from meaning
variations and help identify latent style dimensions. We conduct a qualitative
analysis of latent style dimensions, and show the effectiveness of identified
style subspaces on a lexical formality prediction task.
