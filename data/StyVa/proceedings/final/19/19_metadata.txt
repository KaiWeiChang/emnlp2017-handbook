Abstract#==#While there is wide acknowledgement in NLP of the utility of document
characterization by genre, it is quite difficult to determine a definitive set
of features or even a comprehensive list of
genres. This paper addresses both issues. First, with prototype semantics, we
develop a hierarchical taxonomy of discourse functions. We implement the
taxonomy by developing a new text genre corpus of contemporary German to
perform a text based comparative register analysis.
Second, we extract a host of style features, both deep and shallow, aiming
beyond linguistically motivated features at situational correlates in texts. 
The feature sets are used for supervised text genre classification, on which
our models achieve high accuracy. 
The combination of the corpus typology and feature sets allows us to
characterize types of communicative purpose in a comparative setup, by
qualitative interpretation of style feature loadings of a regularized
discriminant analysis.
Finally, to determine the dependence of genre on topics (which are arguably the
distinguishing factor of sub-genre), we compare and combine our style models
with Latent Dirichlet Allocation features across different corpus settings with
unstable topics.
