Abstract#==#Conversation is a critical component of storytelling, where key information is
often revealed by
what/how a character says it. We focus on the issue of character voice and
build stylistic models with linguistic features related to natural language
generation decisions. Using a dialogue corpus of the television series, The Big
Bang Theory, we apply content analysis to extract relevant linguistic features
to build character-based stylistic models, and we test the model-fit through an
user perceptual experiment with Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The results are
encouraging in that human subjects tend to perceive the generated utterances as
being more similar to the character they are modeled on, than to another random
character.
