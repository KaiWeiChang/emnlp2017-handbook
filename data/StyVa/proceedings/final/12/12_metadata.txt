Abstract#==#Most work on neural natural language generation (NNLG) focus on controlling the
content of the generated text. We experiment with controling several stylistic
aspects of the generated text, in addition to its content. The method is based
on conditioned RNN language model, where the desired content as well as the
stylistic parameters serve as conditioning contexts.
We demonstrate the approach on the movie reviews domain and show that it is
successful in generating coherent sentences corresponding to the required
linguistic style and content.
