Abstract#==#As natural language processing research is growing and largely driven by the
availability of data, we expanded research from news and small-scale dialog
corpora to web and social media. User-generated data and crowdsourcing opened
the door for investigating human language of various styles with more
statistical power and real-world applications. In this position/survey paper, I
will review and discuss seven language styles that I believe to be important
and interesting to study: influential work in the past, challenges at the
present, and potential impact for the future.
