Abstract#==#We present a preliminary study on predicting news values from headline text and
emotions. We perform a multivariate analysis on a dataset manually annotated
with news values and emotions, discovering interesting correlations among them.
We then train two competitive machine learning models – an SVM and a CNN –
to predict news values from headline text and emotions as features. We find
that, while both models yield a satisfactory performance, some news values are
more difficult to detect than others, while some profit more from including
emotion information.
