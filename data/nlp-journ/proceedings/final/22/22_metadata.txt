Abstract#==#We present a prototypical content curation dashboard, to be used in the
newsroom, and several of its underlying semantic content analysis components
(such as named entity recognition, entity linking, summarisation and temporal
expression analysis). The idea is to enable journalists (a) to process incoming
content (agency reports, twitter feeds, reports, blog posts, social media etc.)
and (b) to create new articles more easily and more efficiently. The prototype
system also allows the automatic annotation of events in incoming content for
the purpose of supporting journalists in identifying important, relevant or
meaningful events and also to adapt the content currently in production
accordingly in a semi-automatic way. One of our long-term goals is to support
journalists building up entire storylines with automatic means. In the present
prototype they are generated in a backend service using clustering methods that
operate on the extracted events.
