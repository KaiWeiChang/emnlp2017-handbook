Abstract#==#Experimenting with a dataset of approximately 1.6M user comments from a Greek
news sports portal, we explore how a state of the art RNN-based moderation
method can be improved by adding user embeddings, user type embeddings, user
biases, or user type biases. We observe improvements in all cases, with user
embeddings leading to the biggest performance gains.
