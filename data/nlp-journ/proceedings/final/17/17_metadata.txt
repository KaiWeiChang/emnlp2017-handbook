Abstract#==#We examine the extent to which we are able to automatically identify
constructive online comments. We build several classifiers using New York Times
Picks as positive examples and non-constructive thread comments from the Yahoo
News Annotated Comments Corpus as negative examples of constructive online
comments. We evaluate these classifiers on a crowd-annotated corpus containing
1,121 comments. Our best classifier achieves a top F1 score of 0.84.
