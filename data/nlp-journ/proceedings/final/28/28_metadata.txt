Abstract#==#Fake news has become a hotly debated topic in journalism. In this paper, we
present our entry to the 2017 Fake News Challenge which models the detection of
fake news as a stance classification task that finished in 11th place on the
leader board. Our entry is an ensemble system of classifiers developed by
students in the context of their coursework.  We show how we used the stacking
ensemble method for this purpose and obtained improvements in classification
accuracy  exceeding each of the individual models' performance on the
development data. Finally, we discuss aspects of the experimental setup of the
challenge.
