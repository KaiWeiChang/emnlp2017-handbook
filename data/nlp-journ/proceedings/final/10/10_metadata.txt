Abstract#==#Previous work on the epistemology of fact-checking indicated the dilemma
between the needs of binary answers for the public and ambiguity of political
discussion. Determining concepts represented by terms in political discourse
can be considered as a Word-Sense Disambiguation (WSD) task. The analysis of
political discourse, however, requires identifying precise concepts of terms
from relatively small data. This work attempts to provide a basic framework for
revealing concepts of terms in political discourse with explicit contextual
information. The framework consists of three parts: 1) extracting important
terms, 2) generating concordance for each term with stipulative definitions and
explanations, and 3) agglomerating similar information of the term by
hierarchical clustering. Utterances made by Prime Minister Abe Shinzo in the
Diet of Japan are used to examine our framework. Importantly, we revealed the
conceptual inconsistency of the term Sonritsu-kiki-jitai. The framework was
proved to work, but only for a small number of terms due to lack of explicit
contextual information.
