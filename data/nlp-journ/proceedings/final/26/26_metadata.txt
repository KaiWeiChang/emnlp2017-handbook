Abstract#==#This paper addresses the task of identifying the bias in news articles
published during a political or social conflict. We create a silver-standard
corpus based on the actions of users in social media. Specifically, we
reconceptualize bias in terms of how likely a given article is to be shared or
liked by each of the opposing sides. We apply our methodology to a dataset of
links collected in relation to the Russia-Ukraine Maidan crisis from 2013-2014.
 We show that on the task of predicting which side is likely to prefer a given
article, a Naive Bayes classifier can record 90.3% accuracy looking only at
domain names of the news sources. The best accuracy of 93.5% is achieved by a
feed forward neural network. We also apply our methodology to gold-labeled set
of articles annotated for bias, where the aforementioned Naive Bayes classifier
records 82.6% accuracy and a feed-forward neural networks records 85.6%
accuracy.
