Abstract#==#In this paper we present a recommender
system, What To Write and Why, capable
of suggesting to a journalist, for a given
event, the aspects still uncovered in news
articles on which the readers focus their interest.
The basic idea is to characterize an
event according to the echo it receives in
online news sources and associate it with
the corresponding readers’ communicative
and informative patterns, detected through
the analysis of Twitter and Wikipedia, respectively.
Our methodology temporally
aligns the results of this analysis and recommends
the concepts that emerge as topics
of interest from Twitter andWikipedia,
either not covered or poorly covered in the
published news articles.
