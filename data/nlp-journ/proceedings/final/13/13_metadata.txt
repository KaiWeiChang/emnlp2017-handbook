Abstract#==#We address the issue of the quality of journalism and analyze daily article
revision logs from a Japanese newspaper company. The revision logs contain data
that can help reveal the requirements of quality journalism such as the types
and number of edit operations and aspects commonly focused in revision. This
study also dis- cusses potential applications such as quality assessment and
automatic article revision as our future research directions.
