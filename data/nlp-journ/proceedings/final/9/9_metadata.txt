Abstract#==#Faced with ever-growing news archives, media professionals are in need of
advanced tools to explore the information surrounding specific events. 
This problem is most commonly answered by browsing news datasets, going from
article to article and viewing unaltered original content.
In this article, we introduce an efficient way to generate links between news
items, allowing such browsing through an easily explorable graph, and enrich
this graph by automatically typing links in order to inform the user on the
nature of the relation between two news pieces.
User evaluations are conducted on real world data with journalists in order to
assess for the interest of both the graph representation and link typing in a
press reviewing task, showing the system to be of significant help for their
work.
