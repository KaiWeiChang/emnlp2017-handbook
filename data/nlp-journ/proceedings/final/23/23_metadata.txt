Abstract#==#The discrepancy between science and media has been affecting the effectiveness
of science communication. Original findings from science publications may be
distorted with altered claim strength when reported to the public, causing
misinformation spread. This study conducts an NLP analysis of exaggerated
claims in science news, and then constructed prediction models for identifying
claim strength levels in science reporting. The results demonstrate different
writing styles journal articles and news/press releases use for reporting
scientific findings. Preliminary prediction models reached promising result
with room for further improvement.
