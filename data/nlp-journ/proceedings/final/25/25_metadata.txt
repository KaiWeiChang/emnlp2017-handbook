Abstract#==#We analyze user viewing behavior on an online news site. We collect
data from 64,000 news articles, and use text features to predict
frequency of user views. We compare predictiveness of the headline and
``teaser" (viewed before clicking) and the body (viewed after clicking). Both
are predictive of clicking behavior, with the full article text being most
predictive.
