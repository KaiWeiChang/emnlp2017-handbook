Abstract#==#News media typically present biased accounts of news stories, and different
publications present different angles on the same event. In this research, we
investigate how different publications differ in their approach to stories
about climate change, by examining the sentiment and topics presented. To
understand these attitudes, we find sentiment targets by combining Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with SentiWordNet, a general sentiment lexicon.
Using LDA, we generate topics containing keywords which represent the sentiment
targets, and then annotate the data using SentiWordNet before regrouping the
articles based on topic similarity. Preliminary analysis identifies clearly
different attitudes on the same issue presented in different news sources.
Ongoing work is investigating how systematic these attitudes are between
different publications, and how these may change over time.
