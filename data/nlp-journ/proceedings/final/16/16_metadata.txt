Abstract#==#Chain construction is an important requirement for understanding news and
establishing the context. A news chain can be defined as a coherent set of
articles that explains an event or a story. There's a lack of well-established
methods in this area.

In this work, we propose a methodology to evaluate the "goodness" of a given
news chain and implement a concept lattice-based news chain construction method
by Hossain et al.. The methodology part is vital as it directly affects the
growth of research in this area. Our proposed methodology consists of collected
news chains from different studies and two "goodness" metrics, minedge and
dispersion coefficient respectively. We assess the utility of the lattice-based
news chain construction method by our proposed methodology.
