Abstract#==#Silence is an integral part of the most frequent turn-taking phenomena in
spoken conversations.  Silence is sized and placed within the conversation flow
and it is coordinated by the speakers along with the other speech acts. The
objective of this analytical study is twofold: to explore the functions of
silence with duration of one second and above, towards information flow in a
dyadic conversation utilizing the sequences of dialog acts present in the turns
surrounding the silence itself; and to design a feature space useful for
clustering the silences using a hierarchical concept formation algorithm. The
resulting clusters are manually grouped into functional categories based on
their similarities. It is observed that the silence plays an important role in
response preparation, also can indicate speakers' hesitation or indecisiveness.
It is also observed that sometimes long silences can be used deliberately to
get a forced response from another speaker thus making silence a
multi-functional and an important catalyst towards information flow.
