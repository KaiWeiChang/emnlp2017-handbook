Abstract#==#We consider the automatic scoring of a task for which both the content of the
response as well its spoken fluency are important. We combine features from a
text-only content scoring system originally designed for written responses with
several categories of acoustic features. Although adding any single category of
acoustic features to the text-only system on its own does not significantly
improve performance, adding all acoustic features together does yield a small
but significant improvement. These results are consistent for responses to
open-ended questions and to questions focused on some given source material.
