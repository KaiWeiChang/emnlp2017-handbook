Abstract#==#Vast amounts of speech data collected for language documentation and research
remain untranscribed and unsearchable, but often a small amount of speech may
have text translations available. We present a method for partially labeling
additional speech with translations in this scenario. We modify an unsupervised
speech-to-translation alignment model and obtain prototype speech segments that
match the translation words, which are in turn used to discover terms in the
unlabelled data. We evaluate our method on a Spanish-English speech translation
corpus and on two corpora of endangered languages, Arapaho and Ainu,
demonstrating its appropriateness and applicability in an actual
very-low-resource scenario.
