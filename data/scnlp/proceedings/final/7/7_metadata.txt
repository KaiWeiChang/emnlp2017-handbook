Abstract#==#We present an analysis of parser performance on speech data, comparing word
type and token frequency distributions with written data, and evaluating parse
accuracy by length of input string. We find that parser performance tends to
deteriorate with increasing length of string, more so for spoken than for
written texts. We train an alternative parsing model with added speech data and
demonstrate improvements in accuracy on speech-units, with no deterioration in
performance on written text.
