Abstract#==#Parsing speech requires a richer representation than 1-best or n-best
hypotheses, e.g. lattices. Moreover, previous work shows that part-of-speech
(POS) tags are a valuable resource for parsing. In this paper, we therefore
explore a joint modeling approach of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and POS
tagging to enrich ASR word lattices. To that end, we manipulate the ASR process
from the pronouncing dictionary onward to use word-POS pairs instead of words.
We evaluate ASR, POS tagging and dependency parsing (DP) performance
demonstrating a successful lattice-based integration of ASR and POS tagging.
