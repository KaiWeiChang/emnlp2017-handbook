Abstract#==#This paper presents our novel method to encode word confusion networks, which
can represent a rich hypothesis space of automatic speech recognition systems,
via recurrent neural networks.
We demonstrate the utility of our approach for the task of dialog state
tracking in spoken dialog systems that relies on automatic speech recognition
output.
Encoding confusion networks outperforms encoding the best hypothesis of the
automatic speech recognition in a neural system for dialog state tracking on
the well-known second Dialog State Tracking Challenge dataset.
