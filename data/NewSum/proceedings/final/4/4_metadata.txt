Abstract#==#Summarization of spoken conversations is a challenging task, since it requires
deep understanding of dialogs. Abstractive summarization techniques rely on
linking the summary sentences to sets of original conversation sentences, i.e.
communities. Unfortunately, such linking information is rarely available or
requires trained annotators. We propose and experiment automatic community
creation using cosine similarity on different levels of representation: raw
text, WordNet SynSet IDs, and word embeddings. We show that the abstractive
summarization systems with automatic communities significantly outperform
previously published results on both English and Italian corpora.
