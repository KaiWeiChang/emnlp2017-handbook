Abstract#==#Recent neural headline generation models
have shown great results, but are generally
trained on very large datasets. We focus
our efforts on improving headline quality
on smaller datasets by the means of pretraining.
We propose new methods that
enable pre-training all the parameters of
the model and utilize all available text, resulting
in improvements by up to 32.4%
relative in perplexity and 2.84 points in
ROUGE.
