Abstract#==#We envisioned responsive generic hierarchical text summarization with summaries
organized by section and paragraph based on hierarchical structure topic
models. But we had to be sure that topic models were stable for the sampled
corpora. To that end we developed a methodology for aligning multiple
hierarchical structure topic models run over the same corpus under similar
conditions, calculating a representative centroid model, and reporting
stability of the centroid model. We ran stability experiments for standard
corpora and a development corpus of Global Warming articles. We found flat and
hierarchical structures of two levels plus the root offer stable centroid
models, but hierarchical structures of three levels plus the root didn't seem
stable enough for use in hierarchical summarization.
