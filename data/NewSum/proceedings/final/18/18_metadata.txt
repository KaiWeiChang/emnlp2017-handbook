Abstract#==#The centroid-based model for extractive document summarization is a simple and
fast baseline that ranks sentences based on their similarity to a centroid
vector. In this paper, we apply this ranking to possible summaries instead of
sentences and use a simple greedy algorithm to find the best summary.
Furthermore, we show possibilities to scale up to larger input document
collections by selecting a small number of sentences from each document prior
to constructing the summary.
Experiments were done on the DUC2004 dataset for multi-document summarization.
We observe a higher performance over the original model, on par with more
complex state-of-the-art methods.
