Abstract#==#With the proliferation of Web-based social media, asynchronous conversations
have become very common for supporting online communication and collaboration.
Yet the increasing volume and complexity of conversational data often make
it very difficult to get insights about the discussions. We consider combining
textual summary with visual representation of conversational data as a
promising way of supporting the user in exploring conversations. In this paper,
we report our current work on developing visual interfaces that
present multimedia summary combining text and visualization for online
conversations and how our solutions have been tailored for a variety of domain
problems. We then discuss the key challenges and opportunities for future work
in this research space.
