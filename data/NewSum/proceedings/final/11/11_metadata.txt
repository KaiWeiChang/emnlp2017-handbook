Abstract#==#We present a fully unsupervised, extractive text summarization system that
leverages a submodularity framework introduced by past research. The framework
allows summaries to be generated in a greedy way while preserving near-optimal
performance guarantees. Our main contribution is the novel coverage reward term
of the objective function optimized by the greedy algorithm. This component
builds on the graph-of-words representation of text and the k-core
decomposition algorithm to assign meaningful scores to words. We evaluate our
approach on the AMI and ICSI meeting speech corpora, and on the DUC2001 news
corpus. We reach state-of-the-art performance on all datasets. Results indicate
that our method is particularly well-suited to the meeting domain.
