Abstract#==#We study the problem of domain adaptation for neural abstractive summarization.
We make initial efforts in investigating what information can be transferred to
a new domain. Experimental results on news stories and opinion articles
indicate that neural summarization model benefits from pre-training based on
extractive summaries. We also find that the combination of in-domain and
out-of-domain setup yields better summaries when in-domain data is
insufficient. Further analysis shows that, the model is capable to select
salient content even trained on out-of-domain data, but requires in-domain data
to capture the style for a target domain.
