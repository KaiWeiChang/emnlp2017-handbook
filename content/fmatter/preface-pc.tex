Welcome to EMNLP 2018! This year's technical program consists of three invited talks, 224 oral presentations (including three papers appearing in the Transactions of the ACL), and 335 poster presentations (including seven papers appearing in TACL). To our knowledge, it's the largest NLP conference ever, and it would not have been possible without the help of our program committee members.

This year, we organized the program committee into eight broad areas. For each area, one of our amazing senior area chairs (Jordan Boyd-Graber, Xavier Carreras, Yejin Choi, Philipp Koehn, Alessandro Moschitti, Slav Petrov, Massimo Poesio, and Kam-Fai Wong) headed a team of several other area chairs (totaling 52 across all areas) and an army of reviewers (totaling 1,436 across all areas). We'd like to especially thank those reviewers who agreed to review a full load of papers, which turned out to be a bit heavier than expected!

2018 appears to have been the year of experimentation with new review forms, and EMNLP was no exception. We eliminated many of the traditional numerical ratings and divided up the free-form comments into a small number of separate free-response questions. We tried to make this new structure mirror the structure of a typical review, while encouraging more comprehensive reviewing.

Extrapolating exponentially from the past two years, we expected to receive about 1,800 submissions, but the eventual number exceeded our expectations at 2,231 (excluding empty and duplicate submissions). After removal of invalid submissions and some withdrawals, we sent 2,116 papers out for review. Despite the growing number of submissions, we tried to keep acceptance rates at the same level as past years. The acceptance statistics are shown below.

    Accepted as poster & 211 (15.3\%) & 117 (13.7\%) & 328 (14.7\%) & 7 \\

As in past years, three awards will be given for Best Long Paper, Best Short Paper, and Best Resource Paper. We solicited recommendations for awards from reviewers and area chairs. Following these recommendations, we sent 7 long papers, 5 short papers, and 5 resource papers to three committees chosen from among the area chairs. In the end, we selected two winners for Best Long Paper and one each for Best Short Paper and Best Resource Paper, all of which will be presented in a final plenary session.

We are delighted to have keynote addresses from three giants of our field: Johan Bos, on the future of computational semantics; Julia Hirschberg, on deception detection in speech; and Gideon Mann, on the use of NLP in finance.
