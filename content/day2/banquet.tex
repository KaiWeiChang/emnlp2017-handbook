The  EMNLP 2017 social event will take place in the court yard just outside the venue, directly after the last session of Sunday. Some social events are designed to give attendees a chance to see a popular tourist attraction, but this year, the social event is pure fun and relaxation. All attendees are invited to grab free food at our food trucks, listen to great music, or just chill in the lounge areas. Of course the social event will include surprises, also, but - hey, theyâ€™re surprises.
