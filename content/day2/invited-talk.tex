{\bfseries Abstract:} Since the dawn of human civilization, finance and language technology have been connected. However, only recently have advances in statistical language understanding, and an ever-increasing thirst for market advantage, led to the widespread application of natural language technology across the global capital markets. This talk will review the ways in which language technology is enabling market participants to quickly understand and respond to major world events and breaking business news. It will outline the state of the art in applications of NLP to finance and highlight open problems that are being addressed by emerging research.
