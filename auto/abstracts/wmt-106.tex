This paper documents an undergraduate course at Hunter College, in which one instructor, six undergraduates, and one high school student built 17 machine translation systems in six months from scratch. The team successfully participated in the second Conference on Machine Translation (WMT17) evaluation on the news task in Finnish-English and Latvian-English and on the bio-medical task in French-English, English-French, English-German, English-Romanian, and English-Polish.
