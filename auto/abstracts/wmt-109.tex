Referential translation machines achieve top performance in both bilingual and monolingual settings without accessing any task or domain specific information or resource. RTMs achieve the \$3\$rd system results for German to English sentence-level prediction of translation quality and the \$2\$nd system results according to root mean squared error. In addition to the new features about substring distances, punctuation tokens, character \$n\$-grams, and alignment crossings, and additional learning models, we average prediction scores from different models using weights based on their training performance for improved results.
