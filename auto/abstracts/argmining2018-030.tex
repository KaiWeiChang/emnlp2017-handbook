Argumentation is arguably one of the central features of scientific language. We present \emph{ArguminSci}, an easy-to-use tool that analyzes argumentation and other rhetorical aspects of scientific writing, which we collectively dub \emph{scitorics}. The main aspect we focus on is the fine-grained argumentative analysis of scientific text through identification of argument components. The functionality of \emph{ArguminSci} is accessible via three interfaces: as a command line tool, via a RESTful application programming interface, and as a web application.
