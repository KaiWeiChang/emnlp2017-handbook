This paper presents a set of classification experiments for identifying depression in posts gathered from social media platforms. In addition to the data gathered previously by other researchers, we collect additional data from the social media platform Reddit. Our experiments show promising results for identifying depression from social media texts. More importantly, however, we show that the choice of corpora is crucial in identifying depression and can lead to misleading conclusions in case of poor choice of data.
