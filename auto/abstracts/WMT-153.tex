We present the LMU Munich machine translation systems for the English-German language pair. We have built neural machine translation systems for both translation directions (English-to-German and German-to-English) and for two different domains (the biomedical domain and the news domain). The systems were used for our participation in the WMT18 biomedical translation task and in the shared task on machine translation of news. The main focus of our recent system development efforts has been on achieving improvements in the biomedical domain over last year's strong biomedical translation engine for English-to-German. Considerable progress has been made in the latter task, which we report on in this paper.
