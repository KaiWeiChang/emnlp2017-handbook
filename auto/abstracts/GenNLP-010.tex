This paper describes our submission to the sentiment analysis sub-task of ``Build It, Break It: The Language Edition (BIBI)'', on both the builder and breaker sides. As a builder, we use convolutional neural nets, trained on both phrase and sentence data. As a breaker, we use Q-learning to learn minimal change pairs, and apply a token substitution method automatically. We analyse the results to gauge the robustness of NLP systems.
