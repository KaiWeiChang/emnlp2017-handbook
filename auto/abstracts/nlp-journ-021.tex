In this paper, we present an unsupervised pipeline approach for clustering news articles based on identified event instances in their content. We leverage press agency newswire and monolingual word alignment techniques to build meaningful and linguistically varied clusters of articles from the web in the perspective of a broader event type detection task. We validate our approach on a manually annotated corpus of Web articles.
