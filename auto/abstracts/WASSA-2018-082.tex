This paper describes our participating system in the WASSA 2018 shared task on emotion prediction. The task focusses on implicit emo- tion prediction in a tweet. In this task, key- words corresponding to the six emotion label names (anger, fear, disgust, joy, sad, and sur- prise ) have been removed from the tweet text, making emotion prediction implicit and the task challenging. We propose a model based on ensemble of classifiers for prediction. Each classifier in the ensemble uses sequence of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) archi- tecture blocks and uses ELMo (Embeddings from Language Model) (Peters et al., 2018) as input. Our system achieves 66.2\% F1 score on the test set. The best performing system in the shared task has reported 71.4\% F1 score.
