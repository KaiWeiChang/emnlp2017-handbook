In this paper, we propose a method of calibrating a word embedding, so that the semantic it conveys becomes more relevant to the context. Our method is novel because the output shows clearly which senses that were originally presented in a target word embedding become stronger or weaker. This is possible by utilizing the technique introduced in \cite{Murphy, Arora2016}, the technique of using sparse coding to recover senses that comprises a word embedding.
