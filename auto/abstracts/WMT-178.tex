We present a pilot study of machine translation of selected grammatical contrasts between Czech and English in WMT18 News Translation Task. For each phenomenon, we run a dedicated test which checks if the candidate translation expresses the phenomenon as expected or not. The proposed type of analysis is not an evaluation in the strict sense because the phenomenon can be correctly translated in various ways and we anticipate only one. What is nevertheless interesting are the differences between various MT systems and the single reference translation in their general tendency in handling the given phenomenon.
