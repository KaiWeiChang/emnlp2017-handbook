This paper describes the system that team UChicagoCompLx developed for the 2018 Social Media Mining for Health Applications (SMM4H) Shared Task. We use a variant of the Message-level Sentiment Analysis (MSA) model of Baziotis et al. (2017), a word-level stacked bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network equipped with attention, to classify medication-related tweets in the four subtasks of the SMM4H Shared Task. Without any subtask-specific tuning, the model is able to achieve competitive results across all subtasks. We make the datasets, model weights, and code publicly available.
