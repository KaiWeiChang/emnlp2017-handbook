This study explores a number of data-driven vector representations of the IPA-encoded sound segments for the purpose of sound sequence alignment.  We test the alternative representations based on the alignment accuracy in the context of computational historical linguistics.  We show that the data-driven methods consistently do better than linguistically-motivated articulatory-acoustic features.  The similarity scores obtained using the data-driven representations in a monolingual context, however, performs worse than the state-of-the-art distance (or similarity) scoring methods proposed in earlier studies of computational historical linguistics.  We also show that adapting representations to the task at hand improves the results, yielding alignment accuracy comparable to the state of the art methods.
