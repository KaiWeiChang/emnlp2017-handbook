Differently from the phrase-based paradigm, neural machine translation (NMT) operates on word and sentence representations in a continuous space. This makes the decoding process not only more difficult to interpret, but also harder to influence with external knowledge. For the latter problem, effective solutions like the XML-markup used by phrase-based models to inject fixed translation options as constraints at decoding time are not yet available. We propose a ``guide'' mechanism that enhances an existing NMT decoder with the ability to prioritize and adequately handle translation options presented in the form of XML annotations of source words. Positive results obtained in two different translation tasks indicate the effectiveness of our approach.
