This paper describes an approach to solve implicit emotion classification with the use of pre-trained word embedding models to train multiple neural networks. The system described in this paper is composed of a sequential combination of Long Short-Term Memory and Convolutional Neural Network for feature extraction and Feedforward Neural Network for classification. In this paper, we successfully show that features extracted using multiple pre-trained embeddings can be used to improve the overall performance of the system with Emoji being one of the significant features. The evaluations show that our approach outperforms the baseline system by more than 8\% without using any external corpus or lexicon. This approach is ranked 8th in Implicit Emotion Shared Task (IEST) at WASSA-2018.
