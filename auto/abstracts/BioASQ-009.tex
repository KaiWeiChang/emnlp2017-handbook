A question answering system is a system capable of answering natural language questions. The aim of the system is to tap into the vast unstructured information and aid the researchers by providing a natural language search interface. BioaASQ is a research competition that aims to progress the research in biomedical question answering systems. In this paper, we detail our submission to the BioASQ competition's Biomedical Semantic Question and Answering task. Our system uses extractive summarization techniques to generate answers and has scored highest ROUGE-2 and Rogue-SU4 in all test batch sets.
