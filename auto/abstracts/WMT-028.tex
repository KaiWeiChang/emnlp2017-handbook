This paper describes the our submissions to the WMT 2018 Shared Task on Parallel Corpus Filtering. While evaluating the quality of parallel corpus, the three characteristics of the corpus are investigated, i.e. 1) the bilingual/translation quality, 2) the monolingual quality and 3) the corpus diversity.  Both rule-based and model-based methods are adopted to score the parallel sentence pairs. The final parallel corpus filtering system is reliable, easy to build and adapt to other language pairs.
