Previous phrase-based approaches to Automatic Post-editing (APE) shown that the dependency of MT errors from the source sentence can be exploited by jointly learning from source and target information. By integrating this notion in a neural approach to the problem, we present the multi-source neural machine translation (NMT) system submitted by FBK to the WMT 2017 APE shared task. Our system implements multi-source NMT in a weighted ensemble of 8 models. The n-best hypotheses produced by this ensemble are further re-ranked using features based on the edit distance between the original MT output and each APE hypothesis, as well as other statistical models (ngram language model and operation sequence model). This solution yields significantly better performance compared to standard, single-source neural APE. Our primary submission for the en-de direction improves over the MT baseline up to -4.9 TER and +7.6 BLEU points. On de-en data, where the higher quality of the original MT output reduces the room for improvement, the gains are lower but still significant (-0.25 TER and +0.3 BLEU)
