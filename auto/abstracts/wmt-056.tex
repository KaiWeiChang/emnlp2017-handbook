The paper describes Tilde's English-Latvian and Latvian-English machine translation systems for the WMT 2017 shared task in news translation. Both constrained and unconstrained systems are described. Our constrained systems were ranked as the best performing systems according to the automatic evaluation results. The paper gives details to how we pre-processed training data, the NMT system architecture that we used for training the NMT models, the SMT systems and their usage in NMT-SMT hybrid system configurations.
