In this work we show our work in progress of automating the opinion detection of single sentences given a context. For this, we develop an automated data and label creation process and use a Deep Neural Network (Bi-GRU) model that together fill the gap left by topic modeling and sentiment analysis. Using data mined from Reddit, our inital results of a controversial topic being discussed show how different opinions are expressed during online conversations and their trajectories over time. This method can be extended to analyze political debates and polarization or serve as a tool for journalists for promoting a healthy online debate.
