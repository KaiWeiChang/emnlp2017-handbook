This paper describes the Johns Hopkins University submissions to the shared translation task of EMNLP 2017 Second Conference on Machine Translation (WMT 2017). We set up phrase-based, syntax-based and/or  neural machine translation systems for all 14 language pairs of this year's evaluation campaign. We also performed neural rescoring of phrase-based systems for English-Turkish and English-Finnish.
