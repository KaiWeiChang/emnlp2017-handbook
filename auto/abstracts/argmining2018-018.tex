We explore the use of residual networks for argumentation mining, with an emphasis on link prediction. We propose a domain-agnostic method that makes no assumptions on document or argument structure. We evaluate our method on a challenging dataset consisting of user-generated comments collected from an online platform. Results show that our model outperforms an equivalent deep network and offers results comparable with state-of-the-art methods that rely on domain knowledge.
