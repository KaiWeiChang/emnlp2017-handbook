This paper describes the AFRL machine translation systems and the improvements that were developed during the WMT17 evaluation campaign. This year, we explore the continuing proliferation of Neural Machine Translation toolkits, revisit our previous data-selection efforts for use in training systems with these new toolkits and expand our participation to the Russian---English, Turkish---English and Chinese---English translation pairs.
