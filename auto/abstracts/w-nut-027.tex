We describe the Enron People Assignment (EPA) dataset, in which tasks that are described in emails are associated with the person(s) responsible for carrying out these tasks. We identify tasks and the responsible people in the Enron email dataset. We define evaluation methods for this challenge and report scores for our model and na√Øve baselines. The resulting model enables a user experience operating within a commercial email service: given a person and a task, it determines if the person should be notified of the task.
