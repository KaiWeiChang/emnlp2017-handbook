In this paper, we have explored web-based evidence gathering and different linguistic features to automatically extract drug names from tweets and further classify such tweets into Adverse Drug Effects or not. We have evaluated our proposed models with the dataset as released by the S4MM workshop shared task 1 and Task-3 respectively. Our evaluation results shows that the proposed model achieved good results, with Precision, Recall and F-scores of 78\%, 88\% and 82\% respectively for Task1 and 33\%, 54\% and 41\% for Task3.
