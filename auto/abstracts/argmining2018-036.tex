We created a corpus of utterances that attempt to save face from parliamentary debates and use it to automatically analyze the language of reputation defence.  Our proposed model that incorporates information regarding threats to reputation  can predict reputation defence language with high confidence. Further experiments and evaluations on different datasets show that the model is able to generalize  to new utterances and can predict the language of reputation defence in a new dataset.
