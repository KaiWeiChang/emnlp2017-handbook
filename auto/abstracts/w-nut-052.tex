Swisscom, the biggest Telco in Switzerland, receives more than half a million written requests per year in four languages. The intent and team with the right skills to answer the request are predicted using a machine learning based system. The written customer request plus some additional metadata (e.g. customer segment, communication channel, etc.) are used as features for classification. Historical data contains both noisy text content and noisy labels. An internal crowdsourcing tool has been developed to mitigate the issue.
