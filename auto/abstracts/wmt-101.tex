This paper describes the statistical machine translation system developed at RWTH Aachen University for the English-to-German and German-to-English translation tasks of the EMNLP 2017 Second Conference on Machine Translation (WMT 2017). We use ensembles of attention-based neural machine translation system for both directions. We use the provided parallel and synthetic data to train the models. In addition, we also create a phrasal system using joint translation and reordering models in decoding and neural models in rescoring.
