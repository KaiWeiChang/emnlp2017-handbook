In this paper, we describe the TALP-UPC participation in the News Task for German-English and Finish-English. Our primary submission implements a fully character to character neural machine translation architecture with an additional rescoring of a n-best list of hypothesis using a forced back-translation to the source sentence. This model gives consistent improvements on different pairs of languages for the language direction with the low-est performance while keeping the quality in the direction with the highest performance. Additional experiments are reported for multilingual character to character neural machine translation, phrase-based translation and the additional Turkish-English language pair.
