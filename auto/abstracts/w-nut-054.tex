Twitter is a primary source of social media data, but users' behaviors with retweeting have received much more study than have users' interactions with replying. To explore the substantial proportion of all tweets which are posted in reply to another tweet, we collected a dataset of millions of Twitter conversations and examined the conversational dynamics between users. We built models to predict whether a tweet will start, end, or maintain conversations, and whether a tweet will receive high- or low-quality replies.
