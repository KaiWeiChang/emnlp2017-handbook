In the past few years, bully and aggressive posts on social media have grown significantly, causing serious consequences for victims/users of all demographics. Majority of the work in this field has been done for English only. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning based classification system for Facebook posts and comments of Hindi-English Code-Mixed text to detect the aggressive behaviour of/towards users.  Our work focuses on text from users majorly in the Indian Subcontinent. Our classification model assigns each Facebook post/comment to one of the three predefined categories: ``Overtly Aggressive'', ``Covertly Aggressive'' and ``Non-Aggressive''. We experimented with 6 classification models and our CNN model on a 10 K-fold cross-validation gave the best result with the prediction accuracy of 73.2\%.
