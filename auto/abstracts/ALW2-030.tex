Text classification models have been heavily utilized for a slew of interesting natural language processing problems. Like any other machine learning model, these classifiers are very dependent on the size and quality of the training dataset. Insufficient and imbalanced datasets will lead to poor performance. An interesting solution to poor datasets is to take advantage of the world knowledge in the form of knowledge graphs to augment our training data. In this paper, we use ConceptNet and Wikidata to improve sexist tweet classification by (1) text augmentation and (2) text generation. In our text generation approach, we generate new tweets by replacing words using data acquired from ConceptNet relations in order to increase the size of our training set. In our text augmentation approach, the number of tweets remains the same but their words are augmented (concatenation) with words extracted from their ConceptNet relations and their Wikidata description. In our text augmentation approach, the number of tweets in each class remains the same. Our experiments show that our approach improves sexist tweet classification significantly in all of our machine learning models. Our approach can be readily applied to any other text classification problem using any machine learning model.
