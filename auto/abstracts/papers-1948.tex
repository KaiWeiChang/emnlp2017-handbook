Inducing multilingual word embeddings by learning a linear map between embedding spaces of different languages achieves remark- able accuracy on related languages. How- ever, accuracy drops substantially when trans- lating between distant languages. Given that languages exhibit differences in vocabu- lary, grammar, written form, or syntax, one would expect that embedding spaces of dif- ferent languages have different structures es- pecially for distant languages. With the goal of capturing such differences, we propose a method for learning neighborhood sensitive maps, NORMA. Our experiments show that NORMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for word translation between distant languages.
