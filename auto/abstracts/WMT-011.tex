This paper describes the Neural Machine Translation system of TencentFmRD for Chinese to English and English to Chinese news translation tasks of WMT 2018. Our systems are neural machine translation systems trained with our original system TenTrans. TenTrans is an improved NMT system based on Transformer self-attention mechanism.  In addition to the basic settings of Transformer training, TenTrans uses multi-model fusion techniques, multiple features reranking, different segmentation models and joint learning. Finally, we adopted some data selection strategies to fine-tune the trained system and achieved a stable performance improvement.  Our Chinese to English translation system achieved the second best BLEU scores and fourth best cased BLEU scores among all WMT18 submitted systems.
