This paper describes the joint submission of the QT21 projects for the Englishâ†’Latvian translation task of the EMNLP 2017 Second Conference on Machine Translation (WMT 2017). The submission is a system combination which combines seven different statistical machine translation systems provided by the different groups. The systems are combined using either RWTH's system combination approach, or USFD's consensus-based system-selection approach. The final submission shows an improvement of 0.5 BLEU compared to the best single system on newstest2017.
