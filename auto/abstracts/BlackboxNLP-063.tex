Neural sequence-to-sequence models have proven to be accurate and robust for many sequence prediction tasks, and have become the standard approach for automatic translation of text. Like many deep learning methods, it remains quite difficult to understand or debug.  In this work, we present a visual analysis tool that allows interaction and ``what if''-style exploration of trained sequence-to-sequence models through each stage of the translation process. The aim is to identify which patterns have been learned, to detect model errors, and to probe the model with counterfactual scenario. We demonstrate the utility of our tool through a use case in a German to English translation model.
