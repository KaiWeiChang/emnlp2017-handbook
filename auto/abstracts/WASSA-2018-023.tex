In this paper, we test state-of-the-art Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)  systems trained on a widely used dataset on actual data. We created a new manually annotated dataset of user generated data from the same domain as the training dataset, but from other sources and  analyse the differences between the new  and the standard ABSA dataset. We then analyse the results in performance of different versions of the same system on both datasets. We also propose light adaptation methods to increase system robustness.
