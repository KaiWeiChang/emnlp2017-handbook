This paper investigates learning methods for multi-class classification using labeled data for the target classification scheme and another labeled data for a similar but different classification scheme (support scheme). We show that if we have prior knowledge about the relation between support and target classification schemes in the form of a class correspondence table, we can use it to improve the model performance further than the simple multi-task learning approach. Instead of learning the individual classification layers for the support and target schemes, the proposed method converts the class label of each example on the support scheme into a set of candidate class labels on the target scheme via the class correspondence table, and then uses the candidate labels to learn the classification layer for the target scheme. We evaluate the proposed method on two tasks in NLP. The experimental results show that our method effectively learns the target schemes especially for the classes that have a tight connection to certain support classes.
