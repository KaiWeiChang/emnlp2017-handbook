Detecting stress from social media gives a non-intrusive and inexpensive alternative to traditional tools such as questionnaires or physiological sensors for monitoring mental state of individuals. This paper introduces a novel framework for finding reasons for stress from tweets, analyzing multiple categories for the first time. Three word-vector based methods are evaluated on collections of tweets about politics or airlines and are found to be more accurate than standard machine learning algorithms.
