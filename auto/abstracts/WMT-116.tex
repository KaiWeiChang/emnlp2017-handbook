We participated in the WMT 2018 shared news translation task on English\$\leftrightarrow\$Chinese language pair.  Our systems are based on attentional sequence-to-sequence models with some form of recursion and self-attention. Some data agumention methods are also introduced to improve the translation performance. The best translation result is obtained with ensemble and reranking techniques. Our Chinese\$\rightarrow\$English system achieved the highest cased BLEU among all \$16\$ submitted systems, and our English\$\leftarrow\$Chinese system ranked the third out of \$18\$ submitted systems.
