This paper discusses the representation of coordinate structures in the Universal Dependencies framework for two head-final languages,Japanese and Korean. UD applies a strict principle that makes the head of coordination the left-most conjunct. However, the guideline may produce syntactic trees which are difficult to accept in head-final languages. This paper describes the status in the current corpora and proposes alternative designs suitable for these languages.
