This paper describes the submission of the NiuTrans neural machine translation system for the WMT 2018 Chinese<->English news translation tasks. Our baseline systems are based on the Transformer architecture. We further improve the translation performance 2.4-2.6 BLEU points from four aspects, including architectural improvements, diverse ensemble decoding, reranking, and post-processing. Among constrained submissions, we rank 2nd out of 16 submitted systems on Chinese->English task and 3rd out of 16 on English->Chinese task, respectively.
