Our system is a four stage model consisting of document retrieval, sentence retrieval, natural language inference and aggregation. Document retrieval attempts to find the name of a Wikipedia article in the claim, and then ranks each article based on capitalisation, sentence position and token match features. A set of sentences are then retrieved from the top ranked articles, based on token matches with the claim and position in the article. A natural language inference model is then applied to each of these sentences paired with the claim, giving a prediction for each potential evidence. These predictions are then aggregated using a simple MLP, and the sentences are reranked to keep only the evidence consistent with the final prediction.
