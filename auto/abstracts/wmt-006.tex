This paper describes the Neural Machine Translation systems of Xiamen University for the translation tasks of WMT 17. Our systems are based on the Encoder-Decoder framework with attention. We participated in three directions of shared news translation tasks: Englis->German and Chinese<->English. We experimented with deep architectures, different segmentation models, synthetic training data and target-bidirectional translation models. Experiments show that all methods can give substantial improvements.
