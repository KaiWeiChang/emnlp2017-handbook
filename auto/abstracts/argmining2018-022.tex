Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) are a common type of experimental studies in the medical domain for evidence-based decision making. The ability to automatically extract the \textit{arguments} proposed therein can be of valuable support for clinicians and practitioners in their daily evidence-based decision making activities. Given the peculiarity of the medical domain and the required level of detail, standard approaches to argument component detection in \textit{argument(ation) mining} are not fine-grained enough to support such activities. In this paper, we introduce a new sub-task of the argument component identification task: \textit{evidence type classification}. To address it, we propose a supervised approach and we test it on a set of RCT abstracts on different medical topics.
