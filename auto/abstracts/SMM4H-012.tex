In the current study, we apply multi-class and multi-label sentence classification to sentiment analysis of online medical forums.  We aim to identify major health issues discussed in online social media and the types of sentiments those issues evoke. We use ontology of personal health information for Information Extraction and apply Machine Learning methods in automated recognition of the expressed sentiments.
