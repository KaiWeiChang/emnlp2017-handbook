This paper describes the statistical machine translation system built by the MLLP research group of Universitat Politècnica de València for the German>English news translation shared task of the EMNLP 2018 Third Conference on Machine Translation (WMT18). We used an ensemble of Transformer architecture---based neural machine translation systems. To train our system under ``constrained'' conditions, we filtered the provided parallel data with a scoring technique using character-based language models, and we added parallel data based on synthetic source sentences generated from the provided monolingual corpora.
