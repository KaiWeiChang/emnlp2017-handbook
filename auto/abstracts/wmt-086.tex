This paper describes the University of Sheffield's submission to the WMT17 Multimodal Machine Translation shared task. We participated in Task 1 to develop an MT system to translate an image description from English to German and French, given its corresponding image. Our proposed systems are based on the state-of-the-art Neural Machine Translation approach. We investigate the effect of replacing the commonly-used image embeddings with an estimated posterior probability prediction for 1,000 object categories in the images.
