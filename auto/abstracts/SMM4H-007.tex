This paper describes our system for the first and third shared tasks of the third Social Media Mining for Health Applications (SMM4H) workshop, which aims to detect the tweets mentioning drug names and adverse drug reactions. In our system we propose a neural approach with hierarchical tweet representation and multi-head self-attention (HTR-MSA) for both tasks. Our system achieved the first place in both the first and third shared tasks of SMM4H with an F-score of 91.83\% and 52.20\% respectively.
