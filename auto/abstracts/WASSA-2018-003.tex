Generative models have recently experienced a surge in popularity due to the development of more efficient training algorithms and increasing computational power. Models such as adversarial generative networks (GANs) have been successfully used in various areas such as computer vision, medical imaging, style transfer and natural language generation. Adversarial nets were recently shown to yield results in the image-to-text task, where given a set of images, one has to provide their corresponding text description. In this paper, we take a similar approach and propose a image-to-emoji architecture, which is trained on data from social networks and can be used to score a given picture using ideograms. We show empirical results of our algorithm on data obtained from the most influential Instagram accounts.
