This paper describes the participation of USI-IR in WASSA 2018 Implicit Emotion Shared Task. We propose a relevance feedback approach employing a sequential model (biLSTM) and word embeddings derived from a large collection of tweets. To this end, we assume that the top-k predictions produce at a first classification step are correct (based on the model accuracy) and use them as new examples to re-train the network.
