This paper describes our submissions for the three sub-tasks of the Quality Estimation shared task of WMT17, namely: (i) a word-level prediction system using bilexical embeddings, (ii) a phrase-level labelling approach based on the word-level predictions, (iii) a sentence-level prediction system using word embeddings and handcrafted baseline features. Results are promising for the sentence-level approach, but still very preliminary for the other two levels.
