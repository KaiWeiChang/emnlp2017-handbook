The WMT 2018 Parallel Corpus Filtering Task aims to test various methods of filtering a noisy parallel corpus, to make it useful for training machine translation systems. We describe the AFRL submissions, including their preprocessing methods and quality metrics. Numerical results indicate relative benefits of different options and show where our methods are competitive.
