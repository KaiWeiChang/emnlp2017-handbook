This paper aims to detect specific attributes of a place (e.g., if it has a romantic atmosphere, or if it offers outdoor seating) from its user reviews via distant supervision: without direct annotation of review text, we use the crowdsourced attribute labels of a place as labels of the review text. We then use review-level attention to pay more attention to those reviews related to the attributes. The experimental results show that the model predicts attributes for places from reviews with over 98\% accuracy. The attention weights assigned to each review provide explanation of capturing related reviews.
