Parallel aligned sentences provide useful information for different NLP applications. Yet, this kind of data is seldom available, especially for languages other than English. We propose to exploit comparable corpora in French which are distinguished by their registers (specialized and simplified versions) to detect and align parallel sentences. These corpora are related to the biomedical area. Our purpose is to state whether a given pair of specialized and simplified sentences is to be aligned of not. Manually created reference data show 0.76 inter-annotator agreement. We exploit a set of features and several automatic classifiers. The automatic alignment reaches up to 0.93 Precision, Recall and F-measure. In order to better evaluate the method, it is applied to data in English from the SemEval STS competitions. The same features and models are applied in monolingual and cross-lingual contexts, in which they show up to 0.90 and 0.73 F-measure, respectively.
