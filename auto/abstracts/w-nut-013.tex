This submission describes the development of a fine-grained, text-chunking algorithm for the task of comprehensive MWE segmentation. This task notably focuses on the identification of colloquial and idiomatic language. The submission also includes a thorough model evaluation in the context of two recent shared tasks, spanning 19 different languages and many text domains, including noisy, user-generated text. Evaluations exhibit the presented model as the best overall for purposes of MWE segmentation, and open-source software is released with the submission (although links are withheld for purposes of anonymity). Additionally, the authors acknowledge the existence of a pre-print document on arxiv.org, which should be avoided to maintain anonymity in review.
