Although deep neural network architectures currently pose as state of the art for named entity recognition in noisy text, they are still far from perform as good as in newswire datasets. This 1-page abstract paper summarizes preliminary results for NER on noisy text using features extracted from text and images (Esteves et al. 2017. Named Entity Recognition in Twitter Using Images and Text. Current Trends in Web Engineering - ICWE 2017 International Workshops). We present initial results, current challenges and work in progress through this novel approach.
