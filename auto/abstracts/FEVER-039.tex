We present a three-stage system consisting of a document retriever, sentence selector and claim verifier for the task of fact extraction and verification. The document retriever selects documents with high efficiency and accuracy based on indexing, matching, and filtering of keywords in Wikipedia pages and Pageview-frequency based ranking. The sentence selector is a neural sequence-matching model which can achieve 90.67\% 5-recall on overall evidence retrieval by applying an annealing sampling method for training. Finally, the claim verifier is an improved NLI model containing ontological WordNet features and also combining upstream relatedness score features (from the sentence selector module). With all three components substantially outperforming their counterparts in the original baseline, our final pipeline model can achieve 66.52\% on the FEVER dev set and 64.21\% on the test set, which is two times greater than baseline results and the top leaderboard position (based on preliminary scores).
