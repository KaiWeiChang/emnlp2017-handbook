Automatic translation of documents is an important task in many domains, including the biological and clinical domains. The second edition of the Biomedical Translation task in the Conference of Machine Translation focused on the automatic translation of biomedical-related documents between English and various European languages. This year, we addressed ten languages: Czech, German, English, French, Hungarian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Romanian and Swedish. Test sets included both scientific publications (from the Scielo and EDP Sciences databases) and health-related news (from the Cochrane and UK National Health Service web sites). Seven teams participated in the task, submitting a total of 82 runs. Herein we describe the test sets, participating systems and results of both the automatic and manual evaluation of the translations.
