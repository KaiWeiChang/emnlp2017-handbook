Aspect-level sentiment analysis aims to identify the sentiment of a specific target in its context. Previous works have proved that the interactions between aspects and the contexts are important. On this basis, we also propose a succinct hierarchical attention based mechanism to fuse the information of targets and the contextual words. In addition, most existing methods ignore the position information of the aspect when encoding the sentence. In this paper, we argue that the position-aware representations are beneficial to this task. Therefore, we propose a hierarchical attention based position-aware network (HAPN), which introduces position embeddings to learn the position-aware representations of sentences and further generate the target-specific representations of contextual words. The experimental results on SemEval 2014 dataset show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
