This paper describes the submissions of the team from the University of Tartu for the sentence-level Quality Estimation shared task of WMT18. The proposed models use features based on attention weights of a neural machine translation system and cross-lingual phrase embeddings as input features of a re- gression model. Two of the proposed models require only a neural machine translation sys- tem with an attention mechanism with no addi- tional resources. Results show that combining neural networks and baseline features leads to significant improvements over the baseline features alone.
