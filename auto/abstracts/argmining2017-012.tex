This paper describes a pilot study to evaluate human analysts' ability to identify the argumentation scheme and premises of an argument having an implicit conclusion.  In preparation for the study, argumentation scheme definitions were crafted for genetics research articles.  The schemes were defined in semantic terms, following a proposal to use semantic rules to mine arguments in that literature.
