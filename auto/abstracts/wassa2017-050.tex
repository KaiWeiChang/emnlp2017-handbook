The paper describes experiments on estimating emotion intensity in tweets using a generalized regressor system. The system combines various independent feature extractors, trains them on general regressors and finally combines the best performing models to create an ensemble. The pro- posed system stood 3rd out of 22 systems in leaderboard of WASSA-2017 Shared Task on Emotion Intensity.
