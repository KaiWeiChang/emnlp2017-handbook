Many social media classification tasks analyze the content of a message, but do not consider the context around that message. For example, in tweet stance classification --- where a tweet is categorized according to a viewpoint it espouses --- the expressed viewpoint depends on latent beliefs held by the user. In this paper, we evaluate if incorporating knowledge about the author can improve tweet stance classification.  Furthermore, since author information and embeddings are often unavailable for labeled training examples, we propose a semisupervised pre-training method to predict user embeddings. We find that author embedding pre-training yields improvements on four out of five domains for the SemEval 2016 Task 6A tweet stance classification task over a non-pretrained neural network, although benefits are less discernible on a gun control stance classification dataset of tweets.
