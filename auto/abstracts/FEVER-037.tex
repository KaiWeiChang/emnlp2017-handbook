(NON-ARCHIVAL) In an effort to assist factcheckers in the process of factchecking, we tackle the claim detection task. One of the necessary stages prior to determining the veracity of a claim is the claim detection task, consisting of identifying the set of sentences, out of a long text, deemed capable of factchecking. This paper is a collaborative work between Full Fact, a factchecking organisation, and the University of Warwick. We develop an annotation schema and a benchmark for automated claim detection that is more consistent across time, topics and annotators than previous approaches. The schema is the product of multiple discussions over almost a decade on ``What is a claim?'' happening inside the factchecking organisation. Our annotation schema has been used to crowdsource the annotation of a dataset with sentences from UK political TV shows.  We introduce an approach based on universal sentence representations to perform the classification, achieving an F1 score of 0.83, with over 5\% relative improvement over the state-of-the-art ClaimBuster and ClaimRank. The system was deployed in production to highlight sentences classified as claims and received positive user feedback.
