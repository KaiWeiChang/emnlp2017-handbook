This paper describes our system created for the WASSA 2018 Implicit Emotion Shared Task. The goal of this task is to predict the emotion of a given tweet, from which a certain emotion word is removed. The removed word can be sad, happy, disgusted, angry, afraid or a synonym of one of them. Our proposed system is based on deep-learning methods. We use Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) with word embeddings as an input. Pre-trained DeepMoji model and pre-trained emoji2vec emoji embeddings are also used as additional inputs.
