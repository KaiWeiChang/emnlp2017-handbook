The aim of this paper is to argue for a coherent Universal Dependencies approach to the core vs. non-core distinction. We demonstrate inconsistencies in the current version 2 of UD in this respect --- mostly resulting from the preservation of the argument---adjunct dichotomy despite the declared avoidance of this distinction --- and propose a relatively conservative modification of UD that is free from these problems. IMPORTANT NOTE: This is a cross-submission. This paper has been accepted to COLING 2018 and will appear in the proceedings there.
