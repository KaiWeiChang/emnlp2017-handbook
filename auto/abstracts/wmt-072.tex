While recent changes in Machine Translation state-of-the-art brought translation quality a step further, it is regularly acknowledged that the standard automatic metrics do not provide enough insights to fully measure the impact of neural models. This paper proposes a new type of evaluation focused specifically on the morphological competence of a system with respect to various grammatical phenomena. Our approach uses automatically generated pairs of source sentences, where each pair tests one morphological contrast. This methodology is used to compare several systems submitted at WMT'17 for English into Czech and Latvian.
