We present system details for AUEB's submissions to the BioASQ 6 Document and Snippet Retrieval challenge (Task 6b Phase A). Our models use novel extensions to deep learning architectures that operate solely over the text of the query and candidate document/snippets. Overall, our systems scored at the top or near the top for all batches and metrics of the challenge, highlighting the effectiveness of deep learning for the task.
