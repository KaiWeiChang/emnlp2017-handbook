Measuring entity relatedness is a fundamental task for many natural language processing and information retrieval applications. Prior work often studies entity relatedness in a static setting and unsupervised manner. However, entities in real-world are often involved in many different relationships, consequently entityrelations are very dynamic over time. In this work, we propose a neural network-based approach that leverages public attention as supervision. Our model is capable of learning rich and different entity representations in a joint framework. Through extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, we demonstrate that our method achieves better results than competitive baselines.
