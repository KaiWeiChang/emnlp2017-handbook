We focus on the task of agreement prediction in Basque, as a case study for a task that requires implicit understanding of sentence structure and the acquisition of a complex but consistent morphological system. In a series of controlled experiments, we probe the ability of sequential models to learn agreement patterns and asses different aspects of the problem. Analyzing experimental results from two syntactic prediction tasks --- verb number prediction and suffix recovery --- we find that sequential models perform worse on agreement prediction in Basque than one might expect on the basis of a previous agreement prediction work in English. Tentative findings based on diagnostic classifiers suggest the network makes use of local heuristics as a proxy for the hierarchical structure of the sentence. We propose the Basque agreement prediction task as challenging benchmark for models that attempt to learn regularities in human language.
