In this participation in the WMT'2017 metrics shared task we implement a fuzzy match score for n-gram precisions in the BLEU metric. To do this we learn n-gram embeddings; we describe two ways of extending the word2vec approach to do so. Evaluation results show that the introduced score beats the original BLEU metric on system and segment level.
