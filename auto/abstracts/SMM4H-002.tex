This paper describes the systems developed by IRISA to participate to the four tasks of the SMM4H 2018 challenge. For these tweet classification tasks, we adopt a common approach based on recurrent neural networks (BiLSTM). Our main contributions are the use of certain features, the use of Bagging in order to deal with unbalanced datasets, and on the automatic selection of difficult examples. These techniques allow us to reach 91.4, 46.5, 47.8, 85.0 as F1-scores for Tasks 1 to 4.
