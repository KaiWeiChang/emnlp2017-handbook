We report on the efforts of the Johns Hopkins University to develop neural machine translation systems for the shared task for news translation organized around the Conference for Machine Translation (WMT) 2018. We developed systems for German-English, English-German, and Russian-English. Our novel contributions are iterative back-translation and fine-tuning on test sets from prior years.
