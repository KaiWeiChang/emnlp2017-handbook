In this paper, we propose to adapt the four-staged pipeline proposed by Zubiaga et al. (2018) for the Rumor Verification task to the problem of Fake News Detection. We show that the recently released Fnc-1 corpus covers two of its steps, namely the Tracking and the Stance Detection task. We identify asymmetry in length to be a key characteristic of the latter step, when adapted to the framework of Fake News Detection and propose to handle it as a specific type of Cross-Level Stance Detection. Inspired by theories from the field of Journalism Studies, we implement and test two architectures to successfully model the internal structure of an article and its interactions with a claim.
